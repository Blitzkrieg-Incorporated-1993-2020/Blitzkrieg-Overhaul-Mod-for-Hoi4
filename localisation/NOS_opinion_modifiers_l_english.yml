 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico stands at the closing days of the Maximato, the period when former president Plutarco Elias Calles held the true power in Mexico using right wing loyalists in both politics and the military. Since 1934, Lázaro Cárdenas del Río has waged a political war to end Plutarco's control over the country and enact his own left wing reforms. Mexico stands at a crossroads while the world prepares for war, as the left wing and right wing battle over control of the country's future and where it stands in the coming new world order."
 MEX_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Maximato has ended and Calles is gone, but the battle between the left and right wings is still raging on. Emboldened by the economic hardship caused by the PEMEX embargoes, the right wing have become polarized and now exist in a state of political civil war over who will become the right wing candidate for the presidency next year. The dominant PRI however now rests at a choice between compromising their ideals with the moderate candidate Camacho or double down on the left wing candidate Mugica."
 
 
 # Biographies
 POLITICS_DIONISIO_ENCINA_DESC:0 "Dionisio was described as a polarizing figure, and historians were often found to have very little positive things to say about his leadership. Dionisio was responsible for the fracturing of the largest Mexican communist party, the PCM. He was backed by Soviet agents in charge of spreading communism in Mexico and never acted unless ordered to, and feared that his Soviet handlers would find a more suitable leader for the PCM. This fear caused him to purge anyone who had better leadership skills or charisma from the PCM out of fear that he would be replaced by them, leaving the PCM with a severe lack of good leadership and proactive thinking."
