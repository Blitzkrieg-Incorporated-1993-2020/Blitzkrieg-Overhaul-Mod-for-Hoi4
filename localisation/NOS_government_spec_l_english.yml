 BEL_jean_de_lannoy_desc:0"Descending from a very ancient noble family, Jean de Lannoy is an old general thinking on the nature of modern warfare. As such he held some innovative views compared to the Belgian military establishment as he published articles in which he suggested to use tanks as a weapon enabling to do deadly counter attacks that would stop the enemy advances.

In 1940 he refused to follow the government in exile in London in order to stay with the king. He even said to Leopold III that he could sign the order of resignation of the government as the only minister left in the country. A move that would have harmed the legitimacy of the government of Hubert Pierlot. Hopefully, the King declined his proposal."

This plan however was never implemented as it was judged more important by the government to favour the economic recovery over the preparation for a war that was still seen as hypothetical. He lost his position and went on to command one of the army groups after he invited the French forces to come into the country after one of the many false alarms of the "phoney war" while neither the king or the government were consulted on that matter."

He commanded a division in 1940 but he may have plotted with Degrelle to help his "March on Brussels" and organize a coup but I have only found Degrelle's claim on this, so this looks like another of his historical rewriting. Anyway, after the capitulation he was sent to prison like most of the Belgian generals. In 1944, Léon Degrelle needed a real officer to command the "Légion Wallonie", so he looked for anti-communist Belgian officers. Chardome was convinced after he was told that the king agreed to fight the Soviets. Even if Leopold III was certainly not a enamoured with the communists he never expressed such views. But before joining the front he asked for a permission to return to Belgium and see his family. There he saw the situation of the country and problably received more informations about the course of the war. He was then convinced that this was not the right thing to do and returned to his stalag instead. Even if he never participated in the activities of the Legion he was sentenced to 15 in prison after the war."

During the war he chose to stay in Belgium because he feared that without a proper leadership, the assets of the corporation would be seized by the occupying forces. Instead he gave his name to the "Galopin Doctrine". It consisted in the idea that the economy has to keep running in order to pay the salaries of the population. Even if it partially helped the Germans, this politics was supported by the Belgian government in exile as it was seen as a necessary evil compared to famine. In 1944 he was assassinated by a group of Flemish fascists lead by Robert Jan Verbelen because he represented the pre-war economical ruling class."
