 comp65:0 "Mid 1960s Computing"

There were room-sized mainframes, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, that were built one at a time by companies such as IBM and CDC. There also were smaller, cheaper, mass-produced minicomputers, costing tens of thousands of dollars, that were built by a handful of companies, such as Digital Equipment Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company, for scientific laboratories and businesses."

 tv_guide:0 "Television guidance"
 tv_guide_desc:0 "Television guidance (TGM) is a type of missile guidance system using a television camera in the missile or glide bomb that sends its signal back to the launch platform. There, a weapons officer or bomb aimer watches the image on a television screen and sends corrections to the missile, typically over a radio control link. Television guidance is not a seeker because it is not automated, although semi-automated systems with autopilots to smooth out the motion are known. They should not be confused with contrast seekers, which also use a television camera but are true automated seeker systems."
 ir_guide:0 "Infrared homing"
 ir_guide_desc:0 "Infrared homing is a passive weapon guidance system which uses the infrared (IR) light emission from a target to track and follow it. Missiles which use infrared seeking are often referred to as "heat-seekers", since infrared is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines and aircraft generate and emit heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background."
 laser_guide:0 "Laser guidance"
 laser_guide_desc:0 "Laser guidance is used by military to guide a missile or other projectile or vehicle to a target by means of a laser beam (Lidar), e.g. beam riding guidance or semi-active radar homing (SARH).[7] This technique is sometimes called SALH, for Semi-Active Laser Homing. With this technique, a laser is kept pointed at the target and the laser radiation bounces off the target and is scattered in all directions (this is known as "painting the target", or "laser painting"). The missile, bomb, etc. is launched or dropped somewhere near the target. When it is close enough for some of the reflected laser energy from the target to reach it, a laser seeker detects which direction this energy is coming from and adjusts the projectile trajectory towards the source."
 laser_guide_mun:0 "Precision-guided munition"
 laser_guide_mun_desc:0 "A precision-guided munition (PGM, smart weapon, smart munition, smart bomb) is a guided munition intended to precisely hit a specific target, to minimize collateral damage and increase lethality against intended targets.Because the damage effects of explosive weapons decrease with distance due to an inverse cube law, even modest improvements in accuracy (hence reduction in miss distance) enable a target to be attacked with fewer or smaller bombs. Thus, even if some guided bombs miss, fewer air crews are put at risk and the harm to civilians and the amount of collateral damage may be reduced."

 aam50:0 "Early Air to Air missiles"
 aam50_desc:0 "The US Navy and US Air Force began equipping guided missiles in 1956, deploying the USAF's AIM-4 Falcon and the USN's AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder. The Soviet Air Force introduced its K-5 (missile) into service in 1957."
 aam60:0 "BVR missiles"
 aam60_desc:0 "As missile systems have continued to advance, modern air warfare consists almost entirely of missile firing. The use of Beyond Visual Range combat became so pervasive in the US that early F-4 variants were armed only with missiles in the 1960s."
 rocketry60:0 "1960s Rocketry"
 rocketry60_desc:0 "Liquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in America, the RL-10 engine first flew in 1962. Hydrogen engines were used as part of the Apollo program; the liquid hydrogen fuel giving a rather lower stage mass and thus reducing the overall size and cost of the vehicle."

 ship_torpedo_sub_7:0 "1960 Sub Torpedo"
 ship_torpedo_sub_7_desc:0 "A new guidance method was introduced in the 60s was Wake homing.The torpedo is fired to cross behind the stern of the target ship through the wake, as it does so it uses sonar to look for changes in the water caused by the passage of the ship, such as the small air bubbles. When these are detected the torpedo turns toward the ship then follows a zig-zag course, turning when it detects the outer edge of the wake, to keep itself in the wake. This will eventually bring it to the rear of the ship, where its warhead can do the most damage to propulsion and steering.The system is difficult to jam, though can be distracted by other ships crossing the wake."

 ship_torpedo_sub_9:0 "1980 Sub Torpedo"
 ship_torpedo_sub_9_desc:0 "The 80s torpedo wasitted with both active and passive sonar and could be remotely controlled through a thin wire which connected it to the launching submarine. Wire guidance permits a torpedo to be launched on-first-warning, i.e. when a target is first detected at long range. This permits the torpedo the time needed to close the range while target course and speed is being updated by the submarine's superior sensors and transmitted 'down-the-wire'. The torpedo can also be reassigned to another target or recalled."
 ship_torpedo_sub_10:0 "1990 Sub Torpedo"
 ship_torpedo_sub_10_desc:0 "In a typical engagement, these new torpedoes will run out wire-guided to the general vicinity of the target and then conduct a covert passive search. The high-capacity guide wire system, specifically designed to match the Spearfish's manoeuvre and speed envelope, provides two-way data exchange between the torpedo and launch submarine, maximising the submarine's organic sensor and combat control capabilities.Once at close range the torpedo uses active sonar to classify and home in on its target. High-power transmissions and sophisticated signal processing enable it to accurately discriminate targets from background noise and ensure high resistance to acoustic countermeasures and/or evasive manoeuvres."
