 uk_mw_2:0 "The Universal Carrier"   
 uk_mw_2_desc:0 "Though already in widespread production, the Universal Carrier has yet to be fully embraced by our armed forces.

 uk_mw_3:0 "Mechanise the Artillery"

 colonial_democracy:0 "The Ballot Box"
 colonial_democracy_desc:0 "The Europeans have brought us many things, good and bad, but their parliamentary democracy is undoubtedly their finest creation.

 colonial_protests:0 "Satyagraha"
 colonial_protests_desc:0 "As we see from the National Congress in India, a path to freedom is best tread lightly and peacefully, not with terrorism or violence; as even the European's best attempts at obfuscation cannot deny the righteousness of a nation yearning to be free to their populace"

 colonial_communism:0 "The Bomb"
 colonial_communism_desc:0 "The changes the Europeans have brought to our country will never go away; industrialisation, modernisation, capitalism, all of these now mire our land forever.

 colonial_divide:0 "Divide and Rule"
 colonial_divide_desc:0 "To maintain our power here, and continue the flow of raw goods and money for the Empire, we would do best to distract the local people so they cannot rise up against us.

 FIN_unthinkable_desc:0 "As a country we broke away from the Russian Empire a mere few decades ago. A civil war also ended any hope of communist sentiment spreading in our country.

 FIN_navy_desc:0 "The finnish navy is unusual in that we focus on both the sea, and on our numerous lakes. We need to be prepared on all fronts for enemy intervention."
 FIN_navy_air:0 "Float Planes"
 FIN_navy_air_desc:0 "Finland is in a unque position that in many cases we do not need runways, our numerous lakes work just as well for floatplanes. We should invest in these types of planes as they will serve us well against the enemy."
 FIN_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bomber Focus"
 FIN_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Finland only has so many resources to spend, so we are unlikely to rule the seas by might of ship alone. We should look into technologies that can take out our enemies' ships without the need of too many ships of our own."
 FIN_coastal_def:0 "Coastal Defense Techniques"
 FIN_coastal_def_desc:0 "The defense of Finland's coasts is paramount to our national security. We may not be able to have the largest fleet, but it should at least be effective."
 FIN_coast_ships:0 "Coastal Defense Ships"
 FIN_coast_ships_desc:0 "As our shores are threatened, we need to build more, newer ships in order to mantain our national security."
 FIN_subs:0 "Submersed Defences"
 FIN_subs_desc:0 "Submarines are cheap to produce and are great at what they do, we should invest in them."
 FIN_convoy:0 "Protect Trade"
 FIN_convoy_desc:0 "Our naval trade routes are long and hazardous, and that's before the possibility of enemy subs. We need to ensure the safety of our convoys."

 FIN_dockyards_desc:0 "Dockyards are that which fuel the defense of our shores. We must ensure that they are as large and productive as possible."

 SWE_poro:0 "Execute Operation Poro"
 SWE_poro_desc:0 "Our allies, the Soviet Union, have shown us their plans for Scandinavia. Originally intending to invade us as well, Operation Poro has become infinitely more viable with us as an ally rather than a belligerent. With us and the Soviets combined, the Fins and the Norwgians don't stand a chance."
 SWE_com_militias:0 "Counter Paramilitarist Activities"
 SWE_com_militias_desc:0 "In response to our workers' peaceful protests, the upper classes have dared to create paramilitary organizations to oppress us! We cannot take this indignity sitting down, we must prepare the workers for the revolution to come, and arm them for when those who would wish to crush it act."
 SWE_fourth:0 "Join the Fourth International"
 SWE_fourth_desc:0 "With our country having finally realized that communism is the way of the future, and that Stalin does not practice true communism, it is only natural that we take the next step. Although we share diplomatic ties with Leon Trotsky's Fourth International, we have not officially joined as members. If we wish to bring the revolution round the world, then we should join these fellow revolutionaries so as to better ready ourselves for the struggle to come."
 SWE_permanent:0 "A Permanent Revolution"
 SWE_aland:0 "Contest the Åland Islands"
 SWE_aland_desc:0 "The Åland islands rightfully belong to the Swedish. Unfairly given to the Fins by the League of Nations in 1921, our Swedish brethren cry out for us. Should Finland reject our just territorial demands, then they shall have more than the Soviets to worry about."
 SWE_baltic:0 "Assert Our Claims Over the Baltic"
 SWE_baltic_desc:0 "There was a time when the baltic states were a part of the glorious swedish empire. Although they have been apart from us for a long time, the current political climate may allow us to once again assert our rightful claim over these lands!"

 SWE_repeal_eden:0 "Repeal the Edén Reforms"
 SWE_repeal_eden_desc:0 "During the years of 1918 and 1919, Nils Edén spitefully and wrongfully revoked many of the king's powers. We should re-instate many of the powers of the monarch as is right."

 SWE_trade_uk_desc:0 "Britain has long been a strong trading partner of ours. We should ensure that it stays that way, even as tensions continue to build."
 SWE_trade_ger:0 "Trade With Germany"
 SWE_trade_ger_desc:0 "Our trade with Germany is extremely important. Their power and proximity to ourselves has not gone unnoticed, and we should ensure that we remain on their good side."
 SWE_permittenttrafiken:0 "Permittenttrafiken"
 SWE_permittenttrafiken_desc:0 "Germany has requested that we give them access through our lands so as to better prepare an assault against their enemies from the north. While we are wary of this, they have promised to not transport weapons or goods, only soldiers."
 SWE_look_sov:0 "Diplomatic Soviet Ties"
 SWE_look_sov_desc:0 "Although we recognized the Soviet Union in 1924, we have not really established any strong Soviet ties, largely due to lingering anti-russian sentiment. We should fix this."
 SWE_ally_trade:0 "Allied Trade"
 SWE_ally_trade_desc:0 "Although we cannot directly help the allies, that does not mean that we cannot cut them some favorable trade deals. Preferably in a way that won't attract too much German attention."
 SWE_league:0 "Reform the League of Armed Neutrality"
 SWE_league_desc:0 "Twice in the past we have very successfully participated in the Leagues of Armed Neutrality, preventing other countries from taking advantage of us. With things the way they are, perhaps it would be better for us neutrals to stand together."
 SWE_one_neutral:0 "Non-binding Agreements"
 SWE_one_neutral_desc:0 "Although we understand that other countries may have a harder time mantaining their neutrality, but unfortunately we cannot commit any serious forces to any defence but our own."
 SWE_invite_baltic:0 "Invite the Baltic States"
 SWE_invite_baltic_desc:0 "Once a part of the Swedish Empire, the baltic states are currently enjoying their independance. However they are small and weak, and their neutrality as well as their independance will be hard to keep without outside help. Perhaps they are willing to join our league?"
 SWE_invite_lowlands:0 "Invite the Lowland Countries"
 SWE_invite_lowlands_desc:0 "Located in a precarious situation, the countries of the lowlands stand directly in between Germany and France. Rather than risk being overrun like in the Great War, maybe they are willing to join us for mutual protection?"

 SWE_join_axis_desc:0 "Germany has long been a close trading partner and diplomatic ally. With a New Europe dawning, we cannot be left behind. We should join Germany in their endeavors, securing our place in the future."
 SWE_soviet_base:0 "Soviet Basing Rights"
 SWE_soviet_base_desc:0 "For years our animosity towards Russia and the Soviet Union has caused us to deny them as much access to the Baltic Sea as possible. However the times are changing along with the winds, and offering the Soviets more control over the Baltic along with basing rights should go a long way towards repairing our relations."
 SWE_expand_home:0 "Expand the Home Guard"
 SWE_expand_home_desc:0 "We already have in place a system of volunteer militias who are ready to join the fight at a moment's notice. We can expand upon this system, making it an official part of the Swedish Army, increasing its efficiency and preparedness level."
 SWE_radical_reform:0 "Worker Primacy"

 SWE_moderate_reform:0 "Social Protections"
 SWE_moderate_reform_desc:0 "Upon review of our social policies we have found problems with our current system. Too often those at the very bottom suffer from the very programs designed to help them. We should reform these systems so as to better serve their needs."
 SWE_expand_lotta:0 "Expand the Lottorna"
 SWE_expand_lotta_desc:0 "The Women's Volunteer Defence Service (Lottorna) was created in 1924, inspired by a similar Finnish organization. Here women are able to help the war effort by doing many of the things that soldiers are too busy fighting to do, including making clothing and servicing the sick. Some even train with weapons in case of emergencies! This organization is worthy of our attention, and its expansion."
 SWE_fighting_women:0 "Mobilize the Lottorna"
 SWE_fighting_women_desc:0 "As war drags on we begin to require more men to fight. However, we are beginning to run short of even those barely considered men. Luckily, we have a group of people already used to war, with many of them already familiar with weaponry! Although unorthodox, and certainly at the detriment of the organization's main objectives, we find that we have little choice but to militarize and mobilize the Lottorna as a full fighting force!"
 SWE_building_tech:0 "New Building Techniques"
 SWE_building_tech_desc:0 "Time stops for no-one, and least so in the case of technology. If we wish to stay competitive, we must ensure our technological competativeness."
 SWE_end_neutral:0 "End Policy of Neutrality"
 SWE_end_neutral_desc:0 "The time has come for us to throw off the yoke of neutrality, no longer shall we be held back by our own misguided views of how to ensure peace. For some things can only be wraught at the end of the sword or by the barrel of a gun."
 SWE_guarantees:0 "Guarantee of Rights"
 SWE_guarantees_desc:0 "The people must be respected, and their civil liberties should not be breached. If we wish to make sure that the people understand this, we must not only pay lip service, but enshrine rights in law."
 SWE_military_trade:0 "Increase Military Trade"
 SWE_military_trade_desc:0 "War comes to Europe, we can see it. If we wish to be prepared for this eventuality, then we must make sure that as a nation we are prepared for Europe to once again erupt into flames."
 SWE_infr:0 "Increase Infrastructure Spending"
 SWE_infr_desc:0 "Infrastructure is the literal building block of any country. If we wish to remain a viable and competative force, we must make sure that our infrastructure is up to scratch."
 SWE_ger_coop:0 "German Cooperation"

 SWE_ally_tech:0 "SWE_ally_tech"
 SWE_ally_coop:0 "Allied Cooperation"
 SWE_ally_coop_desc:0 "The allies have at their disposal many advanced technologies and military tactics. Now that we can count ourselves among their number, we can also benefit from this collaberation of great minds."
 SWE_expand_stock:0 "Expand Stockholm College"
 SWE_expand_stock_desc:0 "Stockholm College may be a top tier school in Sweden, but it lacks the international accredidation that even some of our fellow Scandinavian colleges and universities have. By expanding the college, we can increase its appeal, make it more productive, and perhaps even make plans for it to eventually become a university!"
 SWE_expanded_mil:0 "Expanded Military Production"
 SWE_expanded_mil_desc:0 "Our miltary production needs to be ramped up if we ever want any hope of ever defending ourselves from those who would do us harm."
 SWE_exp_civ:0 "Expand Heavy Industry"
 SWE_exp_civ_desc:0 "Even in times of great desperation we cannot afford to let our non-military industry fall behind."
 SWE_expand_mines:0 "Expand the Mines"
 SWE_expand_mines_desc:0 "The iron mines of Sweden are world famous. We recieve orders for our iron from all over the world, and our quality is some of the highest. In addition we also produce good quality Tungsten, which is both rare and valuable. If we are to meet not only our own needs, but that of our customers, we need to expand our mining operations to their limit!"
 SWE_tungsten:0 "Expand Tungsten Production"
 SWE_tungsten_desc:0 "Sweden may not have the world's largest supply of Tungsten in the world, but we certainly do have more than most countries. If we are to capitalize on this rare metal, we need to expand our tungsten production to the highest levels possible!"
 SWE_expand_rail:0 "Expand the Rail Lines"
 SWE_expand_rail_desc:0 "Now that we have increased our mining production, we should also make sure that we can transport our goods to their destinations. More production is useless if we cannot move the extra supply!"
 SWE_defence:0 "Försvarsbeslut"
 SWE_defence_desc:0 "Every five years the military is reviewed before being given instructions on organization and focus in a "Defence Resolution" or "Försvarsbeslut". These resolutions can be used to plan the future of the Swedish military."
 SWE_army_ops:0 "Army Operations Staff"
 SWE_army_ops_desc:0 "Upon reviewing our armed forces, it has become abundently clear that our army is woefully disorganized by modern standards. If we wish to create an effective and modern military we must increase our communication and organization."
 SWE_tank_acquisition:0 "Tank Acquisition"
 SWE_tank_acquisition_desc:0 "Building a tank force is paramount for surviving in a modern war. At current we only possess a handful of old, outdated models. We cannot allow the current situation to remain as is."
 SWE_modern_cav:0 "A Modern Cavalry"
 SWE_modern_cav_desc:0 "Gone are the days of men on horseback riding in to save the day. Instead their will be men riding in metal beasts to the rescue. We need to make sure that this transition happens both quickly and smoothly."
 SWE_secret_ops:0 "Special Operations Staffs"
 SWE_secret_ops_desc:0 "If we are to have a modern army, then we must create departments solely dedicated to such things as Military Intelligence, Cryptography and Photography."
 SWE_air_defence:0 "Air Force Operations Staff"
 SWE_air_defence_desc:0 "The Air Force is too important to be a simple part of another military group. Instead the air force should be organized into its own distinct department, that can take care of all of its own unique needs."
 SWE_anti_air_focus:0 "Air Defence Staff"
 SWE_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "Air warfare has become a major part of war. Defending our territory from bombers and deterring scouts has become a top priority. We cannot entrust this task to an already existing department as they already have their own things to worry about. Instead we should create an anti-air defence department that deals entirely with our enemy's aircraft."
 SWE_navy_staff:0 "Navy Operations Staff"
 SWE_navy_staff_desc:0 "Our navy is one of our nation's greatest pride's and joy's. However its current organizational structure is old and outmoded. A simple restructuring should fix most of its current innefficencies."
 SWE_end_king:0 "Dismantle the Monarchy"
 SWE_end_king_desc:0 "That our country still has a monarchy is an insult to the people. Even more that the "King alone shall govern the realm" remains a part of our constitution. As a communist state, we cannot allow this to stand."
 SWE_north:0 "Rulers of the Norse"
 SWE_north_desc:0 "As the most successful descendents of the Norse, we are also the ones with the greatest claim to inherit their land. All of them."
 SWE_const_reform:0 "Constitutional Reform"
 SWE_const_reform_desc:0 "Although efficient for what we do now, the Swedish constitution is outmoded and needs to be updated for the times. Although we cannot do it immediately, we should start looking into the possibility of rewriting our constitution so that it matches with the times."
 SWE_history:0 "War History Staff"
 SWE_history_desc:0 "The study of history can teach us much, especially when it comes to the matter of warfare. If we can establish a department for the sole purpose of researching and applying military history, it would greatly increase our country's fighting potential."
 SWE_lessons:0 "Lessons of War"
 SWE_lessons_desc:0 "War has a long and complicated history, full of important characters from across the world. Alexander the Great, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Nelson, Napoleon, all these and more have played a great part in our understanding of war. In reading and studying of military practices, we can now work on applying them to our modern day situation. For despite all of our advances, despite all of our advanced technology, war never changes."
 SWE_motor:0 "Army Motorization"
 SWE_motor_desc:0 "The swedish army is disgracefully far behind on modern motorization and mechanization. We should invest in making it so that our troops can be properly supported."
 SWE_crypto:0 "Cryptographical Advances"
 SWE_crypto_desc:0 "As a focal point between the germans and the british, we are in a unique position to listen in to both sides. In doing so we can advance our own cryptographical abilities, both for encryption and decryption."
 SWE_artillery:0 "Support Weapons"
 SWE_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery, Anti-Tank, Anti-Air. All these are required in the modern army if one wishes to stand a ghost of a chance against an opponent. We cannot fall behind now."
 SWE_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms"
 SWE_combined_arms_desc:0 "A modern army is versatile, able to take on any threat. Should we get involved in any fighting, we need to be preapred to fight against any and all opponents, which means we need an army that has perfectly integrated every type of weaponry and tactics available."
 SWE_foreign_fighters:0 "Foreign Fighters"
 SWE_foreign_fighters_desc:0 "Sweden does not currently have the military capacity to produce its own fighters. Instead we need to turn to the world powers and see if any of them are willing to sell."
 SWE_domestic_fighters:0 "Domestic Fighters"
 SWE_domestic_fighters_desc:0 "Sweden can become reliant on foreign powers, we must develop our own fighters as soon as possible!"
 SWE_bomber_comp:0 "Bomber Competition"
 SWE_bomber_comp_desc:0 "Sweden cannot fall behind in its stock of bombers either. We should look into acquiring some."
 SWE_new_focus:0 "Secondary Air Focus"
 SWE_new_focus_desc:0 "Now that we have established production ideals for our fighters, it is time that we turned our attention to creating a second priority for our air forces. Should we focus on tactical bombing, strategic bombing, or some combination therein?"
 SWE_air_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Air"
 SWE_air_lessons_desc:0 "Having now seriously begun our acquisition of airplanes, we can finally begin to seriously look at effective strategems for using our newfound air force. This should prove most fruitful."
 SWE_amphibians:0 "Expand the Coastal Artillery Corps"
 SWE_amphibians_desc:0 "The Coastal Artillery Corps, or Kustartilleriet, is responsible for both protecting our shore from invasion, and for being the first boots on the ground in case we decide to send a naval invason. The KA are some of our toughest and most capable troops, it is time that we increased their size and funding."
 SWE_per_albin_line_1:0 "Coastal Per Albin Line"
 SWE_per_albin_line_1_desc:0 "Sweden cannot be allowed to be invaded by any of our enemies. In order to prevent this, we should create a lane of defence along the coast, preventing a naval assault."
 SWE_per_albin_line_2:0 "The Second Per Albin Line"
 SWE_per_albin_line_2_desc:0 "No plan is perfect, which is why one must always have a contingency plan in place. Should any attackers manage to get through our initial lines at the beaches, we must a have a secondary line ready to repel them from further advance into our country."
 SWE_def_focus:0 "Defensive Focus"
 SWE_def_focus_desc:0 "Sweden is not an aggressive nation, we do not launch attacks. We wait for the enemy to break themselves upon our lines instead."
 SWE_offensive_focus:0 "Offensive Focus"
 SWE_offensive_focus_desc:0 "No-one has ever successfully defended anything. If we wish to win a war, then we must rush the enemy with the force of a thousand storms, sweeping them before us."
 SWE_army_lessons:0 "Lessons From the Ground"
 SWE_army_lessons_desc:0 "Our study of army strategy has greatly increased our knowledge in that area. We are now prepared to adapt the newest and most worthy tactics and strategies!"
 SWE_interceptors:0 "Interceptor Technology"
 SWE_interceptors_desc:0 "Some of our scientists have come forward with a most interesting discovery, one that might forever change the nature of the sky. They claim to be able to make a plane travel several times faster than any current models. Their claims seem far-fetched, but our technicians tell us that their numbers seem correct. There can't be any harm in looking into this promising technology."
 SWE_convoy_protection:0 "Step-Up Convoy Protection"
 SWE_convoy_protection_desc:0 "Trade in the Baltic Sea is our lifeblood. Should the next war come, there will doubtless be attacks on our merchant vessels. As such we should expand as much effort as possible in building new ships that can protect our naval interests."
 SWE_dockyard:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
 SWE_dockyard_desc:0 "We cannot hope to create a powerful navy if we do not have the dockyards to build a navy at all. "
 SWE_dockyard2:0 "Shipbuilding Focus"
 SWE_dockyard2_desc:0 "Although we have expanded our dockyards to accomodate our need for a stronger navy, it is still not enough. If we wish to truly protect our shores then we must expand our fleet even more. And that requires more dockyards."
 SWE_screen:0 "Small Ship Building"
 SWE_screen_desc:0 "A navy does not consist of only large, powerful, ships. It also consists of small, powerful ships. We cannot forget this, and should invest in modern destroyers and light cruisers."
 SWE_heavy_ship:0 "Heavy Ship Building"
 SWE_heavy_ship_desc:0 "Large ships are things to be feared. Bristling with guns and ready to destroy all those who would dare oppose them. Our navy could use more of them."
 SWE_mil_fac:0 "Expand Military Industrial Capacity"
 SWE_mil_fac_desc:0 "Our guns need bullets to fire them, our planes need wings to fly, and our tanks need motors to drive. None of these things are created by magic, but by men in factories. We have men, we should give them factories."
 SWE_sub_focus:0 "Submersed Warfare"
 SWE_sub_focus_desc:0 "Not all of the fighting on the high seas has to take place above the sea. Below it lurks the submarines, waiting to destroy their much larger prey. Good subs can take out a ship several times their size and sneak away before anyone knows what hit them. We should invest in these deadly beasts of the deep."
 SWE_navy_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Sea"
 SWE_navy_lessons_desc:0 "As a scandinavian nation and as the descendants of the Norse, we have extensive knowledge and history of the sea. It is time that we finally compiled that knowledge and ensured it continuity. We can learn ten thousand lessons from the sea."
 SWE_navy_air:0 "Naval Air Power"
 SWE_navy_air_desc:0 "If we wish to truly control the seas, we cannot just focus on the seas themselves. We must also look to the skies. As large as ships may be, they are vulnerable to the payloads dropped by naval bombers."
 SWE_blitzkrieg:0 "Mobile Warfare"
 SWE_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "A modern army must strike quickly and without remorse. What better way than with tanks and other armored vehicles?"
 SWE_mass_assault:0 "Mass Assault"
 SWE_mass_assault_desc:0 "To win a war we must throw as more soldiers than the enemy can handle at any given location. We may not have the largest population, but by concentrating our infantry in strategic locations, we can break through their lines and force them to surrender!"
 SWE_superior_fire:0 "Superior Firepower"
 SWE_superior_fire_desc:0 "The guns of Sweden are strong, backed by a long history of quality weaponry. We may not be able to outnumber the enemy, but we will certainly be able to outgun them!"
 SWE_grand_battle:0 "Grand Battleplan"
 SWE_grand_battle_desc:0 "War will not come to Sweden swiflty, protected as we are from immediate attack. We should take advantage of this and make plans for every possible contigency. Should the enemy come knocking, we will have been expecting him."
 SWE_fake_oil:0 "Alternative Fuels"
 SWE_fake_oil_desc:0 "When war strikes we are cut off from much of that which we take for granted. Chief among these are oil and rubber. If we are going to be missing these materials, perhaps we can find alternatives, for at least a little while?"
 SWE_coastal_defence:0 "Coastal Defence"
 SWE_coastal_defence_desc:0 "The defence of our coastline is critical to our nation's survival, we should make sure that our operations on this matter are not only up to scratch, but better than everyone else."
 SWE_secrets:0 "Military Secrets"

 NOR_full_train:0 "Revise Training Regime"
 NOR_full_train_desc:0 "For the last couple of decades we have reduced the amount of training recruits recieve to historically low amounts. This has made their training efficient monetarily, but with war looming we are beginning to realize that perhaps this was not the best system.

 NOR_rehabilitate_navy_desc:0 "The Royal Norwegian Navy has long been a source of pride for our country, respectably keeping our neutrality assured in the Great War.

 NOR_split_fin:0 "Split Finland"
 NOR_split_fin_desc:0 "We already know that the Soviet Union desires the Karelian territory, however we know that attacking Finland is not as simple as it first appears. In exchange for our help, the Soviets would surely split the spoils of war?"

 CHL_public_works:0 "Public Works"
 CHL_public_works_desc:0 "The budget has finally been balanced thanks to Alessandri. We should invest in some major public works to display the grandeur of great Chile and remind her people of this as well. In doing so there will also be great stimulation in the construction industry which should help renew the economy."
 CHL_urbanisation_focus:0 "Encourage Urbanisation"
 CHL_urbanisation_focus_desc:0 "The time has come to move Chile from a predominantly rural and agricultural society to a truly modern economy.

 CHL_land_reform_auth:0 "Appropriate the Haciendas"
 CHL_land_reform_auth_desc:0 "The Hacendados have proven themselves intolerable overlords. They must be punished and reminded of their place. Appropriating some of their lands and introducing new legislation should resolve the problem simply."
 CHL_land_reform:0 "Agricultural Reform"
 CHL_land_reform_desc:0 "The agricultural sector in Chile is shackled to the Hacendados and their, almost feudal, system. It will be difficult because of their influence but the problem must be resolved to deal with this agricultural crisis. Legislation alone will not be enough - coercion will be required as well."
 CHL_full_recovery:0 "Full Economic Recovery"
 CHL_full_recovery_desc:0 "The economy of Chile has been revinvigorated thanks to the various investments and advancements in the economy. Furthermore, Chile no longer relies so wholly on foreign economies for its own prosperity. In future, we will be better prepared for economic turmoil."

 CHL_efe_rail_desc:0 "Empresa de Ferrocarriles del Estado, the National Railway Enterprise, was founded in 1884 and has tracks running accross Chile. However, it has been some time since the railways were updated and the trains grow outdated. We should invest in the company with renewed vigor for the benefit of all industries and people within Chile."
 CHL_steel:0 "Expand the Steelworks"
 CHL_steel_desc:0 "The national steelworks has proven a most worthwhile enterprise. It is only sensible to further invest where we have resources. Let us construct a huge steel mill at Huachipato - the region has signs of raw materials in addition to a peculiar fervor for football."

 CHL_el_ariostazo:0 "El Ariostazo"
 CHL_el_ariostazo_desc:0 "It is time for the removal of the republic. Democracy is weak and can easily be swayed. A strong military government is what Chile needs in these most turbulent times. A coup d'etat shall befall this government: one which shall not fail."
 CHL_the_pacts_of_may:0 "Abolish the Pacts of May"
 CHL_the_pacts_of_may_desc:0 "The Pactos de Mayo were signed in 1902 and defined the military relationship between Chile and Argentina. Perhaps, the time has come to reconsider our relationship with the Argentines."
 CHL_claims_on_argentina:0 "Taking Tierra del Fuego"
 CHL_claims_on_argentina_desc:0 "Our border with the Argentines was defined in 1902 but with the revision of this our border must also be revised.

 CHL_claims_on_uruguay:0 "Securing the South Atlantic Ocean"
 CHL_claims_on_uruguay_desc:0 "With Argentina under us control of the South Atlantic also falls under our jurisdiction.

 CHL_mobility_focus:0 "Mobility Focus"
 CHL_mobility_focus_desc:0 "The future of warfare is in mobility. Tanks represent a major shift in the nature of warfare and we must change accordingly or be swept away by the tide of history. Chile will be at the forefront of third generation warfare and shall lead the way in the Americas."
 CHL_infantry_focus:0 "Infantry Focus"
 CHL_infantry_focus_desc:0 "Tanks may be an interesting experiment but Chile does not have the industry to pursue such fanciful escapades. We should rely on tried and tested methods of warfare: infantry and artillery."

 CHL_cruiser_focus:0 "Cruiser Focus"
 CHL_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "The increase in naval aviation necessitates increased air cover for our fleets. Light cruisers are the perfect ship for this job and will also act as effective screens for our larger vessels."
 CHL_naval_bomber_focus:0 "New Torpedo Bomber Designs"
 CHL_naval_bomber_focus_desc:0 "It is all well and good having modern carriers but they are useless without modern aircraft. We must update our torpedo bomber designs to ensure that they can strike out effectively and to devastating effect."
 CHL_expand_talcahuano:0 "Expand the Talcahuano Shipyard"
 CHL_expand_talcahuano_desc:0 "Our largest shipyard is at Talcahuano but it is insufficient for our needs. We must expand our naval capacity to allow for larger designs of ship to be built."
 CHL_expand_magallanes_valparasio:0 "Expand Magallanes and Valparaiso"
 CHL_expand_magallanes_valparasio_desc:0 "Our secondary shipyards at Magallanes and Valparaiso must also be expanded to allow for greater shipbuilding capacity. Here, our screens shall be built."

 CHL_universities:0 "Invest in the Universites"
 CHL_universities_desc:0 "Let us establish two new universites: Bio Bio and Playa Ancha. In order to remain competitive Chile must be at the forefront of science both civilian and military. These instiutions will allow us to do so."
 CHL_military_research_institute:0 "Establish ICIA"
 CHL_military_research_institute_desc:0 "Our military has grown large and with it has our experience - it is now the time that we should establish a military research institute. Let it be called the Institucion Chilena de Investigacion Avanzada: the Chilean Institute for Advanced Research."
 CHL_mechanized:0 "Mechanized Effort"
 CHL_mechanized_desc:0 "Tanks cannot operate alone - they require scouts and support units to protect them. However, motorized units are lackluster and so we should outfit new vehicles combining the strengths of armour and turrets with the versatility of infantry."
 CHL_armour_effort:0 "Armour Effort"
 CHL_armour_effort_desc:0 "Tanks are the hammer of our mobile army. It is imperative that we develop new models to outclass our opponents and leave their weapons useless against our armour."

 CHL_artillery:0 "Artillery Effort"
 CHL_artillery_desc:0 "Our strategy is centered around bombarding the enemy as much as possible until they submit. As such, it is only natural that we develop new models of artillery to bombard our opponents more accurately and more devastingly."
 CHL_support:0 "Support Effort"
 CHL_support_desc:0 "Infantry alone is ineffective. Not only does infantry require ordinance support but logistical, reconnaissance and specialist support. We should not allow these elements of our army to lag behind."
 CHL_rockets:0 "Rocketry"
 CHL_rockets_desc:0 "Our researchers have come to us with an interesting proposition: rockets. They say that the future of artillery lies in their exploitation. Certainly, we are not the type to turn down an opportunity for an even more effective way of bombarding our foes. We should investigate these rockets and see if they are worthwhile."
 CHL_naval_doctrine:0 "Naval Doctrine Advancement"
 CHL_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Our new vessels mandate new tactics. We should practice with them and discover new exploits we can take advantage of."
 CHL_marines_focus:0 "Chilean Marines"
 CHL_marines_focus_desc:0 "Our new fleet rules the waves all around us. It is only sensible that we take advantage of this and use marines to capture our enemies' coastline. Our current special forces should be expanded to cover these operations."
 CHL_nationalise_all:0 "Nationalise All Industry"
 CHL_nationalise_all_desc:0 "For too long have the bourgeois grown fat off the labour of the common man. No longer shall we tolerate indolent overseers and tyrannical taskmasters.

 CHL_communist_faction:0 "Found the Communist Latin Union"
 CHL_communist_faction_desc:0 "The Comintern makes a mockery of true communism - they are not even socialists. Stalin is no more than a despotic tsar ruling through fear. We should found our own faction of truly communist states and propagate our own revolution."
 CHL_communist_brazil_influence:0 "Influence Brazil"

 CHL_communist_bolivia_paraguay_war:0 "Spread the Revolution North"

 CHL_preemptive_measures:0 "Pre-emptive Measures"
 CHL_preemptive_measures_desc:0 "We must prepare ourselves for the unfortunate inevitability of war. Peru is the most immediate threat but we should ready ourselves for any eventuality."
 CHL_join_allies:0 "Join the Allies"
 CHL_join_allies_desc:0 "Alone Chile is vulnerable to external powers greater than herself. We must find Allies to help defend ourselves against those who would seek to tear down our democracy and we must reciprocate in ensuring that liberty everywhere is protected."
 CHL_trade_deals:0 "Trade Deals"
 CHL_trade_deals_desc:0 "Chile is too closely linked with Germany and the other fascist ilk for prosperity. We should pursue new trade opportunities with the other democracies of the world."
 CHL_expand_private_sector:0 "Expand the Private Sector"
 CHL_expand_private_sector_desc:0 "Far too much of the Chilean economy is publicly owned. We should reduce the government's involvement to increase competition and efficiency. Both the people and the economy shall benefit from this."

 CHL_crackdown:0 "Crackdown on the Dissidents"
 CHL_crackdown_desc:0 "The radical left and radical right have ran rampant in this country for too long. No more can the government simply be reactionary to their attempted coups and violent outbursts. We must seek out and remove the political threat they pose to our nation."
 CHL_ties_with_argentina:0 "Pursue Ties with Argentina"

 CHL_patriotic_leagues:0 "Re-establish the Patriotic Leagues"
 CHL_patriotic_leagues_desc:0 "The Patriotic Leagues were a paramilitary organisation which ensured the nationalist spirit of Chile was never quashed, however, they dissolved some ten years since. We should re-establish this honourable organisation and encourage it."
 CHL_ban_communism:0 "Ban Communism"

 CHL_expand_alliance:0 "Expand the Alliance"
 CHL_expand_alliance_desc:0 "We should expand our alliance to our neighbours to strengthen ourselves and also to protect them from any warmongering neighbours. Uruguay is of strategic importance in the Atlantic region but cannot defend itself. We should offer for them to join us."
 CHL_paraguayan_threat:0 "The Paraguayan Threat"
 CHL_paraguayan_threat_desc:0 "Paraguay cannot be allowed to remain on our border. They propose a communist regime which threatens the delicate balance of South America. If we do not act soon then they may send agents against us first."

 CHL_establish_the_airforce_desc:0 "Linea Aerea Nacional was established in 1932 under Carlos Ibáñez del Campo but, as yet, it is only a small fleet. The skies will prove a necessary battlefield and, as such, aircraft a necessary investment. Our military industrial complex cannot facilitate an enormous air force so we should focus on making the best use of what we have."
 CHL_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
 CHL_bomber_focus_desc:0 "We should focus or aviation efforts on bombers as they are versatile and have a strong payload."
 CHL_cas_focus:0 "Support Focus"

 CHL_bomber_focus_2:0 "Tactical Bombers"

 CHL_heavy_fighter_focus:0 "Heavy Fighters"
 CHL_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Enemy bombers acost Chile like a swarm of wasps. Heavy fighters will be ideal for eradicating them and will be useful in maintaining air superiority in the remote and distant areas of South America."
 CHL_fighter:0 "Fighters"

 CHL_jet_focus:0 "Jet Effort"
 CHL_jet_focus_desc:0 "The universites tell us of new forms of engine: jet engines. They say these engines would allow for a new breed of aircraft far more powerful than any of those which have come before it. These sound like bold claims but the prospect is too enticing to ignore."

 CHL_naval_fighter_focus:0 "Naval Fighter Focus"

 CHL_japan_accord:0 "Accord with Japan"
 CHL_japan_accord_desc:0 "Chile has long been a significant naval power in the pacific. The Japanese have become a powerful force in the region of late. We should suggest an accord between our nations to prevent future conflict: the shall control the West and North Pacific whilst we control the South and South-East."
 CHL_fascist_constitution:0 "Redraft the Constitution"

 CHL_the_leader_desc:0 "The Leader's power must be absolute to ensure the course of the nation is indomitable. With a new constitution drafted we can formally consolidate the powers of EL Jefe.

 CHL_extirpation:0 "Extirpate Undesirables"
 CHL_extirpation_desc:0 "Long has Chile been accosted by dubious characters. The Chilean people are of the highest character and form. We must remove those who fall short of our expectations and appropriate their resources for the moral and physical health of the nation."
 CHL_communist_conquest:0 "Liberate South America"
 CHL_communist_conquest_desc:0 "The other regimes in South America are oppressive and capitalist - there is no hope for them. We must forcefully liberate our neighbours from their shackles and usher in a new age of plenty."
 CHL_anti_americanism:0 "Anti-Americanism"
 CHL_anti_americanism_desc:0 "America is decadent and corrupt. The American influence in Chile is detestable to say the least. We must eradicate the foolish and frail ideas America propogates else we may also fall to their decadence."
 CHL_japan_faction:0 "An Alliance with Japan"
 CHL_japan_faction_desc:0 "Having agreed to share the Pacific with Japan we should formalise an alliance to help secure it between us. America will be pushed back where it belongs and we shall once more rule this ocean."

 CHL_support_argentinian_coup:0 "Support a Coup in Argentina"
 CHL_support_argentinian_coup_desc:0 "The Peronists have widespread popular support within Argentina but the government will not let them take over. We should support a putsch in Argentina to secure their rule."

 CHL_expand_alliance_bol:0 "Return Tarapacá to Bolivia"
 CHL_expand_alliance_bol_desc:0 "We conquered Tarapacá from Bolivia after the War of the Pacific in 1904 in the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Unfortunately, it did not result in so much friendship.

 CHL_expand_alliance_pru:0 "Return Arica to Peru"
 CHL_expand_alliance_pru_desc:0 "Arica was part of the Peruvian province of Tarapacá until 1883 when we conquered it following the War of the Pacific.

They oppress those that they claim to uplift, they silence any who raise their voice against them and when things look grim, they abandon those they swore to protect.

 NEW_ITA_comintern_tech:0 "Soviet Scientist Swap"
 NEW_ITA_comintern_tech_desc:0 "The Soviets have made great strides in many areas of research, and they have access to some of the best scientists and laboratories in the world.

 NEW_ITA_decolonization:0 "True Colonial Upliftment"
 NEW_ITA_decolonization_desc:0 "Our country is not innocent in the spread of imperialism. We too have taken land from innocents and governed in a most hamfisted way.

Native peoples will be given administrative positions, given control of most affairs, and we will begin actually investing and building in their regions."
 NEW_ITA_invest_colonies:0 "Colonial Investment"
 NEW_ITA_invest_colonies_desc:0 "The colonies deserve more. We have ruled them as imperialists for far too long. We must treat them as any other human beings. We will build factories in their regions and invest in the locals rather than our own administrative elites."

 NEW_ITA_die_yugo_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is not a real country, it is a giant powderkeg created by Serbia due to blow at anytime. Half of the country does not even want to be a part of it!

 LIB_rightful_rulers_desc:0 "It is no secret that Germany has a problem in Africa, not least that their... less than tolerant policies have turned possible supporters into ardent enemies.

 LIB_foreign_training:0 "Foreign Officer Training"
 LIB_foreign_training_desc:0 "Although our military stands proud and ready for combat, it still pales in comparison to much of the rest of the civilized world. Our allies have armies envied around the globe, and we should learn all we can from them."

 LIB_form_airforce:0 "Create the Liberian Air Corps"
 LIB_form_airforce_desc:0 "Our nation has lagged far behind in the skies. The number of planes in our ocuntry can be counted on hands, and none of them serve a military purpose! We will change this with the creation of a new air force, ready to take on any who dare oppose us!"
 LIB_ind_airports:0 "A Place to Land"

 LIB_ind_port:0 "A True Port"
 LIB_ind_port_desc:0 "The port in Monrovia barely begs the name. So rocky and treacherous most boats refuse to land, anchoring offshore and taking smaller boats to the shore. It is high-time that we built a real port in Liberia."
 LIB_ind_nav_doc:0 "Develop Naval Doctrine"
 LIB_ind_nav_doc_desc:0 "Now that we have the capacity for a navy, we need to consider what the navy will actually do beyond the very basics. Shoot the other guy does not a strategy make."
 LIB_marines_focus:0 "River, Jungle and Ocean"
 LIB_marines_focus_desc:0 "Liberia does not have the most immediately hospitable climate in the world. Our soldiers must learn to survive high heat, jungles, and rivers. We should encourage the best of those soldiers and create a special task force for them to train and serve in."

 LIB_combined_tech:0 "Combined Technologies"
 LIB_combined_tech_desc:0 "The different parts of our military have been working fairly independently from one another. This has led to duplicate designs and wasted time.

 LIB_trade_concessions:0 "Trade Concessions"

 LIB_secure_US:0 "Secure US Protection"
 LIB_secure_US_desc:0 "The United States stands besides us as our protector. Only through their friendship have we been able to survive the storms of European imperialism.

 LIB_us_mil_coop:0 "US Military Cooperation"
 LIB_us_mil_coop_desc:0 "Our Frontier Force has become a caricature of corruption and incompetence. No-one trusts them and we cannot rely on them for protection. The US has offered us some of their officers from their Colored Troop regiments in order to train our soldiers and teach our officers. "

 LIB_us_backed_neutrality_desc:0 "With war once again waging across the world it has become more and more difficult to mantain our position of neutrality as other nations sink our ships and refuse to hand out navicerts.

 LIB_air_nav:0 "Air Navigation Agreement"
 LIB_air_nav_desc:0 "As we close our relationship with the United States, our interests have become more and more intertwined. Our country's lack of airfields or bases has caught the attention of the US, who recognize our strategic importance. They have offered to build air bases and airfields in our country in exchange for their free use of said airfields. We have no reason to not accept these free buildings."
 LIB_us_training:0 "American Training Methods"
 LIB_us_training_desc:0 "As we continue to retrain our military, we have found that our old training methods were not only inadequate, but next to useless. Luckily we have American officers to show us how to properly train a soldier."

 LIB_fix_militia:0 "Update the Militia"
 LIB_fix_militia_desc:0 "Based upon the original American militias such as the "Minutemen", Liberian militias stand ready to fight should our country ever come under attack. At least they should. In practice however they are poorly trained, have to buy their own equipment, and have low motivation. If we wish to actually rely on our militia, we must ready them just as we ready our regular forces."
 LIB_focus_mil:0 "Focus on the Frontier Force"

 LIB_areas_defense:0 "Areas Defense Agreement"
 LIB_areas_defense_desc:0 "As the war progresses, we only grow closer to the United States, both financially and militarily. They have offered to build infrastructure, military bases, and more so long as we allow them to use those things over the course of the war. We cannot turn down such expensive projects when offered at no cost! Especially not to such a close ally."
 LIB_expand_gold:0 "Expand the Gold and Diamond Mines"
 LIB_expand_gold_desc:0 "All that glitters is not gold sometimes it's diamonds. We have been mining both since the 1800's, but we have lacked the technology and financial means to truly tap into these resources. It's time that we finally began to make a move."
 LIB_interior_infra:0 "Interior Infrastructure"

 LIB_us_mil_facs:0 "New Arms Factories"
 LIB_us_mil_facs_desc:0 "The US cannot simply just import every single weapon that it needs. They need some local way of creating their war materials. Luckily for them, we are quite willing to give them the land they need to construct their factories."
 LIB_mil_sup:0 "US Military Lend-Lease"

 LIB_port:0 "Port Agreement"
 LIB_port_desc:0 "Liberia has long suffered from not having a proper port. Many companies have expressed interest in our country only to turn away from our rocky and treacherous shores that lack any way for their ships to safely dock. The US has gracefully offered to build us a large and modern port. The proceeds of the port will go to the US until the building cost has been repaid, but this is a tiny price to pay for such an extravagant building project!"
 LIB_navy:0 "Liberian Naval Thought"
 LIB_navy_desc:0 "Outside of a few dinghy's not even big enough to deserve the term "boat" Liberia has lacked any sort of naval presence, relying entirely on the US for protection from the seas. Now that we have begun to modernize and the US has begun to build us a real port, we can finally begin to think about how to defend the coastline ourselves."
 LIB_nav_tech:0 "Naval Technologies"
 LIB_nav_tech_desc:0 "We are hopelessly behind in naval technologies, we can only try as hard as we can to catch up."
 LIB_end_neutrality:0 "Join the Fight"

 LIB_pay_on_time:0 "On-Time Pay"
 LIB_pay_on_time_desc:0 "For too long our soldiers have had to put up with mountains of arrears, being paid weeks or months after they were supposed to have been. Our adminstrative reforms have allowed for a greater efficiency that removes any reason for a continuation of this situation."
 LIB_mil_doc:0 "Liberian Military Doctrine"

 LIB_modern_guns:0 "Import Modern Guns"
 LIB_modern_guns_desc:0 "Our guns certainly work, but when compared to the rest of the world, we are very far behind. We need to upgrade our arsenal so that our soldiers can match the rate of fire and accuracy of the enemy. Otherwise we shall be torn apart even if we do manage to reform our military!"
 LIB_modern_arty:0 "Modern Artillery"

 LIB_auto_tech:0 "Import Automobiles"
 LIB_auto_tech_desc:0 "Cars, trucks and other automobiles are relatively new to Liberia. We have fallen behind their use not only in the transportation industry, but in the war-fighting industry as well! We need to import foreign vehicles so that we can begin producing our own."
 LIB_armor_tech:0 "Great Tractors"
 LIB_armor_tech_desc:0 "We were not impressed when we first heard of the Great Tractors in Europe, until we realized that they were death on treads. Now we realize that we must study them, so that we can fight them, and perhaps someday make some of our own!"
 LIB_special_forces:0 "Elite Forces"
 LIB_special_forces_desc:0 "Up until now, our idea of elite troops were the non-corrupt Frontier Force soldiers. Now that we have paid and disciplined soldiers, we can begin the process of establishing specialized forces made up of the best of the best."
 LIB_jungle_training:0 "The Advantages of Africa"
 LIB_jungle_training_desc:0 "Although our location in Africa has caused our country many problems, from an isolated position to difficulty building settlements. However, our military training has caused us to realize that there are advantages to our location. Our troops are prepared for environments that most troops from Europe or America are unprepared for. We should capitalize on this advantage, for it is one of the few we have."
 LIB_greenback:0 "Complete Switch to Greenback"
 LIB_greenback_desc:0 "Starting last year our country has begun the process of switching out the pound for the US dollar. We do still produce some of our own currency, but this way we have an internationally accepted currency that does not hail from an imperialist power who wished our country gone."

 ETH_gas_reform_desc:0 "For all of our attempts at modernization, we were not ready for a modern war. The enemy has unleashed upon us the most heinous of devices of modern warfare, mustard gas! As they rule the skies the Italians continually bomb our soldiers as they run for cover and gas us whenever they fear our victory. There are techniques for lessening the impact of these attacks, we just have to make sure that our whole army learns these lessons. Preferably before we are overrun."

Although we have constructed defences to the south of Dagghabur, our own "Maginot Line", there is nothing stopping our enemies from simply going around it.

 ETH_break_arms_embargo_desc:0 "When the Italians began their invasion, the British and French declared a full arms embargo, knowing full well that this would only help the Italians. They even went so far as to seize weapons that had been donated to our cause. Now we are even more poorly equipped than ever before, and if we wish to fight back, we will need to try and break this embargo by all means necessary."
 ETH_jap_support:0 "Japanese Support"

 ETH_ger_support:0 "German Support"
 ETH_ger_support_desc:0 "Of all the countries in Europe, it was the Germans who sent us supplies. Not the democracies, not the protectors of liberalism, not the revolutionaries, but the Nazis. We owe them much, and had it not been for French interference we would have a small mountain of German rifles. We should see if this support still rings true."
 ETH_fra_support:0 "French Support"
 ETH_fra_support_desc:0 "The French speak a good game, but when push came to shove they did nothing to stop the Italian invasion. They even seized shipments of weapons destined for our country due to the arms embargo, depriving us of much needed supplies. Perhaps this could be re-negotiated?"
 ETH_eng_support:0 "British Support"

Although many of their citizens supported our cause, the government could not imagine backing us Africans over our European attackers. Still, they border our country and pose an immediate threat. We must make nice or die."
 ETH_follow_jap:0 "Follow the Japanese Example"
 ETH_follow_jap_desc:0 "The events of the war have only proven the thoughts of Herouy Wolde Selassie and the other 'Young Japanisers' correct. The West fears a Japan of Africa, as they should. We rise with the sun, in the model of Japan."
 ETH_leave_lon:0 "Leave the League of Nations"
 ETH_leave_lon_desc:0 "Enough of the hypocrisy, enough of the inaction. The League works only for the powerful countries and does nothing for those who need it. It has become clear that the model of internationalism is fundamentally broken. We must speak for ourselves, because no-one else will."
 ETH_re_invite_foreign_missions:0 "Re-Invite Foreign Missions"
 ETH_re_invite_foreign_missions_desc:0 "The war caused all but our most loyal foreign agents to flee. Without them, our military will have a hard time modernizing. If we wish to drag ourselves into the modern era, we will need some foreign support and training."
 ETH_inter_invest:0 "International Investment"

 ETH_fra_roads:0 "Expand the Djibouti Rail Lines"
 ETH_fra_roads_desc:0 "Our rail lines are rather... lacking. Our mountainuos country makes building tracks or roads difficult. With the help of the French, we should be able to at least make modest improvements in our rail line, perhaps creating a couple more that lead to and from Djibouti, benefiting both parties."
 ETH_improve_encryption:0 "Improve Encryption"
 ETH_improve_encryption_desc:0 "Our country has relied mainly on runners do to our lack of radio for many years, and although we have now begun acquiring radios we do still have a problem.

 ETH_more_congress:0 "Increase the Power of the Legislature"
 ETH_more_congress_desc:0 "The current constitution has the Parliament acting largely as an advisory body with little true power, with its main advantage being the ability to keep the nobles tied up in the capital as senators rather than causing trouble at home. We should push for an increase in Legislative power in order to try and force at least some control over the Emperor's whims. "
 ETH_solidify_imperial_power:0 "Solidify Imperial Power"

 ETH_swedish_quality:0 "Swedish Quality"
 ETH_swedish_quality_desc:0 "The Swedish were one of our more vocal supporters during the war, and we shall never forget that. Their weapon quality has been proven and we know that we can trust them. This is a good time to deepen our relationship with them."
 ETH_go_communist:0 "The Voice of the People"
 ETH_go_communist_desc:0 "For far too long the people of Ethiopia have been oppressed. Even as power has supposedly been granted to them, it only hides the fact that the true masters remain the same. The people work and others benefit. The time has come so that every person gains the benefit of their own labour."
 ETH_com_militias:0 "From Levies to Militias"
 ETH_com_militias_desc:0 "Every man is expected to be ready to fight for the Empire in case of attack. We can use this to our advantage by connecting people across the land and creating more formalized militias. The best part is that it will appear to be a boon for the Empire, when in fact these militias will be its death!"

 ETH_turn_evil:0 "Look Into The Darkness"
 ETH_turn_evil_desc:0 "Our closer relationship to Germany has allowed us to take a closer look into their governance and beliefs, and there is much to be admired there. We can use our German contacts to begin creating our own tracts on the ruling class."
 ETH_as_in_the_east:0 "The Eastern Dawn"
 ETH_as_in_the_east_desc:0 "The Japanese are the rightful rulers of the Far East, their actions and power speak to theat. The Germans have proven themselves the masters of Europe. But what of Africa? We are the unconquered people, the ones whom no European can match. When the New World Order comes, we will rule the continent in friendship with the Japanese and Germans. Together we will create the perfect triarchy!"

 ETH_restrict_nobles:0 "Restrict Noble Priveleges"
 ETH_restrict_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have had a stranglehold on the country for years and only in the last couple of decades have we been able to loosen their grasp. Winning the war has given us, at least temporarily, a unique opportunity. We need to use our popularity to reign in the nobles while we still can."
 ETH_abolish_slavery:0 "Abolish the Gedar System"
 ETH_abolish_slavery_desc:0 "The Gedar system is a horribly outdated idea that significantly weakens our outside influence and restricts our ability to modernize. Sure the nobles like this feudalistic system that encourages what essentally amounts to slavery, but the Italians got a lot of positive press for claiming to be coming in to abolish this system. We cannot allow another country to define the narrative in such a way ever again!"
 ETH_gradual_emancipation:0 "Gradual Land Reform"

 ETH_ger_contracts:0 "German Military Contracts"
 ETH_ger_contracts_desc:0 "Germany's help in the war has made us view their companies with favour. Perhaps some could be enticed to open shop in our country? Or at least invest in our own, local companies."
 ETH_expansionism:0 "Expansionism"
 ETH_expansionism_desc:0 "Our destiny holds that we are to expand beyond our current, meagre borders. We must bide our time for the perfect time to swoop in and take what we can!"
 ETH_grab_djibuoti:0 "Grab Djibouti"
 ETH_grab_djibuoti_desc:0 "France has fallen, and it can no longer protect it's colonies. We will never have a better chance to seize Djibouti. The garrison there is strong, but perhaps we can convince them and what remains of the French government to surrender peacefully."
 ETH_grab_somaliland:0 "Demand British Somaliland"
 ETH_grab_somaliland_desc:0 "British Somaliland stands as an affront to our destiny of controlling the Horn of Africa. Either they stand down peacefully, or we take the province by force, and it's not like the British are currently in any position to refuse!"
 ETH_remove_italy:0 "Remove Italy"
 ETH_remove_italy_desc:0 "Italy has been a thorn in our side for far too long. They have now attacked us not just once, but twice. Either they stand down, or we remove them forcefully once and for all."
 ETH_take_africa:0 "Africa for Africans"

 ETH_puppet_yemen:0 "Across the Sea"
 ETH_puppet_yemen_desc:0 "Yemen has long been forced to play host to Britain, France and Italy. Now they have us to deal with as well. Their land has been taken from them, we can get it back, for a price. The price of loyalty."
 ETH_foreign_military_investment:0 "Foreign Military Investment"
 ETH_foreign_military_investment_desc:0 "Now that we have ingratiated ourselves with a few key players, we can try and entice their military companies to expand in our country. We are willing to be very generous with our terms."

 ETH_coop_eng_infr_desc:0 "The British African colonies are tremendously under-developed, a fact that the British are very well aware of. But together we can try and alleviate this somewhat. Together we can expand the rail lines in both our country and in the English colonies, creating more connections and generally just increasing the local infrastructure."
 ETH_a_new_ally:0 "A New Ally"
 ETH_a_new_ally_desc:0 "Germany grows ever stronger. The British and French will need all the help they can get. We offer ourselves as a possible ally, all we need is the ability to conduct our own war effort."

 ETH_expand_the_army_desc:0 "We may have access to a large number of troops, but most of those are the personal troops of the Rases, not the Imperial Army which is rather small comparitively. If we wish to mantain imperial power, we will need to make sure that the Imperial Army is the largest and strongest of them all."
 ETH_ras_cooperation:0 "Cooperate With the Rases"
 ETH_ras_cooperation_desc:0 "We cannot go this alone, we need the help of select Rases in order to bring the rest of the country to heel. It may mean making some concessions, but it's better than failing due to lack of support."
 ETH_shun_rases:0 "[ETH_imperial_or_communist2]"
 ETH_shun_rases_desc:0 "We cannot trust the Rases with any power whatsever, they have proven themselves fickle allies at best. A couple will be trusted, but by and large we should focus on the Imperial Troops, not those of the Rases."
 ETH_air_force:0 "Air Force Investment"
 ETH_air_force_desc:0 "Our air force barely deserves the name. A few planes gifted to us from those sympathetic to our cause does not exactly strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. The Italians have shown us the horrors of Air Supremacy, and we should not forgot those lessons."
 ETH_buy_planes:0 "Plane Purchases"
 ETH_buy_planes_desc:0 "We can only build planes so quickly when we have so little industry. We must look to see if any countries are willing to sell us their overstock. Even out-of-date models will allow us to build up a fleet and give our would-be pilots experience in the air."
 ETH_coastal_defence_tactics:0 "Coastal Defence"
 ETH_coastal_defence_tactics_desc:0 "We cannot hope to compete on the high seas. We need to focus on building ships that can reasonably defend us from invasion from close to shore, coastal defence ships. This is our future."

 ETH_air_navy_coop:0 "Navy and Air Force Cooperation"
 ETH_air_navy_coop_desc:0 "Our navy and air force are very new compared to the established army. We should take this opportunity to make sure that these to branches work with one another rather than against. We admire Japan, but that does not mean that we want to be a carbon copy!"

 ETH_carrier_focus_desc:0 "We may be a bit far away from being able to produce our own carriers, but the sooner we study the tech, the better!"
 ETH_float_planes:0 "Naval Planes"
 ETH_float_planes_desc:0 "Further studies of Air and Naval cooperation has shown us the importance of naval planes. Bombers that can take out enemy ships, fighters that defend these bombers. Variations of both that can fit on and be launched from a ship. These are all things that we should be looking into."
 ETH_wolfpacks:0 "Wolfpacks"
 ETH_wolfpacks_desc:0 "Submarines are extremely useful. They are cheap, easy to cosntruct and can wreck havic on an unprepared enemy. We should make use of these versatile weapons."

 ETH_flagship:0 "The Imperial Flagship"
 ETH_flagship_desc:0 "What is a navy without a flagship? We have expanded our dockyards and begun building ourselves a fleet, but it needs something special. We need a large ship that truly epitomizes the grace of the Empire and the Emperor."

 ETH_light_plane_focus:0 "Local Air Defence Focus"

 ETH_heavy_plane_focus:0 "An Air Force Abroad"
 ETH_heavy_plane_focus_desc:0 "We will not be fighting over own skies so much as we will in far away lands. If we wish to reach these places, we must focus on planes that can make those kinds of trips."
 ETH_integrate_eritrea:0 "Eritrean Integration"
 ETH_integrate_eritrea_desc:0 "We have finally reclaimed the lost province of Eritrea! We need to re-integrate these people back into our empire as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there are those who would stand in our way, the so-called Eritrean nationalists who foolishly believe that Eritrea's destiny differs from the Empires. Perhaps we could assuage some of their members by grantingt the province greater autonomy, for now."
 ETH_crush_eritrea:0 "Crush Eritrean Nationalism"
 ETH_crush_eritrea_desc:0 "The Eritreans have proven to be slippery and traitorous. Already there are those within the province that demand self-government! This kind of anti-imperial sentiment cannot be tolerated!"
 ETH_establish_somalian_puppet:0 "A Land for the Somalis"
 ETH_establish_somalian_puppet_desc:0 "The various Somali peoples in our lands have long not exactly been the most stable subjects. However, this largely stems from the lack of a coutnry they can truly call their own that isn't ours. With our control of Somalia, we can change that. We will create a highly autonomous puppet state under the governership of a loyal Somali. This will hopefully quell much of the Somali unrest in our country."
 ETH_order_in_somalia:0 "Force Somalian Integration"
 ETH_order_in_somalia_desc:0 "The Somalians in our country have long resisted and resented our rule. They simply refuse to follow the rules of the empire. For too long we have been unable to punish this behavior, but times have changed. They will obey our rule, or else."
 ETH_another_light:0 "Another Light Against The Darkness"
 ETH_another_light_desc:0 "Germany's expansion has gone from worrying to downright terrifying. We must stand up to this egregious breach of international trust. We must not allow another country to be invaded as we were, and we will not stop at mere finger-pointing!"
 ETH_join_japan:0 "African-Asian Prosperity"
 ETH_join_japan_desc:0 "Our future lies with the east. There is simply too much baggage in Europe for us to tie ourselves too closely to any European country. We will work on collaberating with the Japanese."
 ETH_own_way:0 "Tilt the Axis"
 ETH_own_way_desc:0 "Germany has only increased their support for our country. This marks an excellent opportunity for us to truly ingratiate ourselves with them. The rest of the world will tremble when we join hand in hand with the Germans."
 ETH_stand_against_expansionism:0 "Stand Against Expansionism"
 ETH_stand_against_expansionism_desc:0 "What happened to our country cannot be allwed to be repeated again on the world stage. We must stand as a beacon of hope for all those who stand against tyranny, to show that it can be done."

 ETH_elecronic_focus:0 "Electronic Focus"
 ETH_elecronic_focus_desc:0 "Elctricity and electronics in general are severely lacking in our country. We should begin to put serious thought into creating an electrical framework. In addition, we really need to get our hands on military-grade electronics. They will doubtless be of extreme importance in the future, and we do not wish to be left behind."
 ETH_modern_weapons:0 "Weapons for the Modern Age"
 ETH_modern_weapons_desc:0 "The importance of modern weaponry may be somewhat overstated at times, we ourselves have proven this multiple time. But we still cannot pretend that they are very helpful. Our country relies far too heavily on pre-established weaponry, much of it pre-1900. The time has definitely come for an upgrade. Several upgrades actually."
 ETH_trucks:0 "Capacity for Mechanized Units"
 ETH_trucks_desc:0 "Our country has only recently been getting involved with automobiles. Our country is largely not conducive to them, but with changing technologies this has become less and less of an excuse. We need to start preparing ourselves for the future of warfare, or else find ourselves run over by it."
 ETH_motor_infr:0 "Road Construction"
 ETH_motor_infr_desc:0 "One of the major issues our country faces is a serious lack of roads, especially paved ones. Granted, mountain roads are hard to make and mantain, but we must do so if we wish to connect our country and join the modern world."
 ETH_tank_focus:0 "Our Own Armor"
 ETH_tank_focus_desc:0 "The Italians used armour against us in the war, and we proved that it was not as great as advertised, at least in the north. The south however tells us a different story, armour in a flat setting can be absolutely devastating, and we need to create some of our own as soon as possible!"
 ETH_arty_focus:0 "Modern Artillery"
 ETH_arty_focus_desc:0 "Our artillery is, in many cases, laughable. We still have cannons, actual cannons, in our arsenal. This is unacceptable for a modern army. Work must be done in order to rectify this problem."
 ETH_anti_tank_focus:0 "Anti-Tank Preparedness"
 ETH_anti_tank_focus_desc:0 "Our country wimply does not have the resources to participate in the armour race. We should instead focus on how to counteract the presence of armour. If we cannot join them, then shoot them dead."

 ETH_oletta_school:0 "Expand the Oletta School"
 ETH_oletta_school_desc:0 "The Oletta Cadet School has finally had its first graduates, and we can proudly state that the experiment has been a success. These young leaders of Ethiopia have already proven themselves as new thinkers, ready to think and act in ways that our old guard never would. The time has come to end the old ways, and schools such as Oletta will greatly expediate this process."
 ETH_axis_tech:0 "Technological Access"
 ETH_axis_tech_desc:0 "Now that we have joined together with another power to take on the world, we need to have the  ability to actually do so. Luckily. our allies seem willing to cooperate with us on this matter."

 ETH_eritrean_industry:0 "Build Up Eritrean Industry"
 ETH_eritrean_industry_desc:0 "For all their claims of uplifting the Africans, the Europeans have really done a shoddy job of actually bringing real industry to the continent. It now lies to us to show the Eritreans proper industry."
 ETH_somalian_industry:0 "Bring Industry to Somalia"
 ETH_somalian_industry_desc:0 "Somalia has been almost cruelly left behind when it comes to industrial advances. Ever since their conquest by Italy, the region has essentially been a dead zone outside of a few key cities. We aim to change this. Industry will come to Somalia."

  LAT_Rebuild_Lithuanian_Infrastructure_desc:0 "To connect Lithuania and Latvia better we need to work on Lithuania’s outdated infrastructure. By modernizing and connecting Lithuania’s infrastructure to our infrastructure we can optimize the connection both in industrial and civil way which will help us economically and defensively. This will be great way to make Lithuanians feel better with their new rule."
  LAT_Rebuild_Estonian_Infrastructure:0 "Rebuild Estonian Infrastructure"
  LAT_Rebuild_Estonian_Infrastructure_desc:0 "By rebuilding Estonia’s infrastructure we will show our will to invest in Estonia and do good for them as well. It will also make connection between Latvia and Estonia easier and faster. We will have easier port connections from our industries in Northern Latvia and will allow Estonians to easier get to their new capital."
  LAT_Expand_University_of_Latvia:0 "Expand University of Latvia"
  LAT_Expand_University_of_Latvia_desc:0 "University of Latvia is the biggest and most important university in our nation. It has been lacking some funding lately and they can’t expand so quickly. We have possibility to focus some funs on our university and let it expand giving us more educated students and perhaps some technology research possibilities."
  LAT_Grand_Potato_Project:0 "Grand Potato Project"
  LAT_Grand_Potato_Project_desc:0 "There have been some talks about these Nuclear weapons in the major nations. They’re supposedly are big and powerful which could lead some nations to world domination. But who says that only majors can focus on this goal of making such weapons? We should start putting some funds and scientists to work on this new type of weapon."
  LAT_New_VEF_Project:0 "New VEF Project"
  LAT_New_VEF_Project_desc:0 "VEF has been working on a lot of things, planes, radios, electric cars and many more. Their latest idea comes from major nations which are testing rocket science. VEF suggests that we also should start working on such technology, it will allow us to defend ourselves and also try to reach space. Perhaps we could be the first nation to visit the moon?"
  LAT_Baltic_Industrial_Powerhouse:0 "Baltic Industrial Powerhouse"
  LAT_Baltic_Industrial_Powerhouse_desc:0 "Now that our infrastructure with other Baltic lands are connected and modernized, we can focus on our industry. We have potential to build up an industrial powerhouse, we have the land, infrastructure and workers. This will give work to our people and bring goods to us and other nations which will pay us for our products. Baltics are known for their quality products and we shall embrace it."
  LAT_Baltic_University:0 "Baltic University"
  LAT_Baltic_University_desc:0 "We have several big universities in our nation but we could make program which connects them all into one. If we make one big Baltic University it would allow more people to study and on higher level. This will also allow us to research more technology at the university giving us goods for our nation."
  LAT_Improve_Latvian_Export:0 "Improve Latvian Export"
  LAT_Improve_Latvian_Export_desc:0 "Latvian export products are considered as high quality and even high class in some other nations. Our products are demanded outside of our nation and this could improve our economy greatly if we start producing more of Latvia’s popular products, such as milk products, linen products, other farm goods and even electronics."
  LAT_Expand_Vairogs_Production:0 "Expand Vairogs Production"
  LAT_Expand_Vairogs_Production_desc:0 "Vairogs has been producing trams, wagons and other heavy transportation for our and export market. But perhaps we should consider of giving it a chance in production of different vehicles? There’s possibility to work together with American Ford and start production of trucks, cars and various other vehicles in Riga."
  LAT_Expand_VEF_Production:0 "Expand VEF Production"
  LAT_Expand_VEF_Production_desc:0 "VEF is famous for its electronical achievements and products, but we shouldn’t stop there yet. We have several engineers and inventors who are willing to work with VEF to start producing something different. Kārlis Irbītis would like to start line of Latvian made aircraft and Baltic German Walter Zapp has idea of making small spy cameras Minox which could be the smallest cameras in the world."
  LAT_Construction_of_Keguma_VES:0 "Construction of Ķeguma VES"
  LAT_Construction_of_Keguma_VES_desc:0 "Ķeguma VES or Ķeguma National Power Station could be the answer for our needed electricity needs. We can build it on the river Daugava which has plenty of power to supply our nation with its stream and waves. This project could also become a national wonder, since taking such challenge is not an easy task, especially for nation which has never built big dams over big rivers."
  LAT_Supplies_for_Army:0 "Supplies for Army"
  LAT_Supplies_for_Army_desc:0 "One of greatest challenges in our army is the supply. Many of major nations around the world product ammunition and supplies for their army in their own factories without need of other nations resources. This could benefit our army and economy if we would try to improve and fix the situation with supplies and ammunition in our army."
  LAT_Vairogs_in_Army:0 "Vairogs in Army"
  LAT_Vairogs_in_Army_desc:0 "Vairogs which has started production on new and modern trucks and cars could be good supplier for our army. Our army is in need of mobile and reliable trucks which could transport soldiers, ammunition, supplies and other various things to place of need. Our commanders could also use some of the cars produced by Vairogs aswell."
  LAT_Modernize_VEF_Aircraft:0 "Modernize VEF Aircraft"
  LAT_Modernize_VEF_Aircraft_desc:0 "VEF has started a new line in their production called Irbītis. It’s a line of Latvian engineered and made aircraft and our army could use some homemade aircraft. They’re still not perfect but if we work together with VEF, we could improve them and grow our air force by a lot."
  LAT_Latvian_Rifle_Industry:0 "Latvian Rifle Industry"
  LAT_Latvian_Rifle_Industry_desc:0 "One of things that aren’t produced in our own nation is pistols, rifles and machine guns which are used by our army. If we would have our own weapon producer it would be easier to get what our army needs and wants. Good base for a brand new factory would be the A.B. Patšautene which was designed by Latvian in 1925 as a prototype for our army."
  LAT_Military_Effort:0 "Military Effort"
  LAT_Military_Effort_desc:0 "Our military has been slowly demobilizing since the end of our independence war in 1920. Nowadays the threat of security is raising duo political scandals and we should mobilize our army to stand against any threat. Our army also needs more modern equipment to match major nation armies, and if we want to stand against bigger nations, we need to build our army up now."
  LAT_Border_Security:0 "Border Security"
  LAT_Border_Security_desc:0 "One of best national defenses is its border, if we focus on our border line, improve security, build defenses, and other measurements, we will improve national defense by a lot. Other issue could be the internal security. If war starts some people may run away just to not join the army, or will join the opposite side in the conflict, and that’s also something that we should consider on improving."
  LAT_Fortify_the_East:0 "Fortify the East"
  LAT_Fortify_the_East_desc:0 "By building first defense on our eastern border we will secure better possibility to fight against the Soviet Union. If we will ever end up in conflict with them, our troops will be able to defend our border from the massive red army. This is just a start, and in future we should improve the border defenses."
  LAT_Focus_on_Outside_Security:0 "Focus on Outside Security"
  LAT_Focus_on_Outside_Security_desc:0 "Focusing on our outside borders is more secure way of defending our nation and improving the border defenses will not let the enemy troops to march through our land. We can also focus on some other borders that we have, not just the border with Soviet Union."
  LAT_Focus_on_Internal_Security:0 "Focus on Internal Security"
  LAT_Focus_on_Internal_Security_desc:0 "Internal security is just as important as border security. Some people in case of war might decide to betray us and join the enemy’s side. Also some people may not be willing to join the army or support the cause of the war, and we should address all of these things in our nation."
  LAT_Lithuanian_Border_Security:0 "Lithuanian Border Security"
  LAT_Lithuanian_Border_Security_desc:0 "While our borders are now defended with proper defenses against the Soviet border, the Lithuanian border is empty and insecure. To improve our defenses we need to invest some resources and time on the Lithuanian borders since we never know from where and who could attack us."
  LAT_Estonian_Border_Security:0 "Estonian Border Security"
  LAT_Estonian_Border_Security_desc:0 "Estonia is well secured by its Lake Peipus but that doesn’t mean the land borders are secure. If we built up some defenses in Narva and Petseri we’ll be able to hold Estonian lines from Soviet attack quite well and not allow Soviets to march through Estonia straight into Tallinn or Riga."
  LAT_Baltic_Wall:0 "Baltic Wall"
  LAT_Baltic_Wall_desc:0 "Our outside borders against every nation are secured but not as great as it could be. Our highest defense point is in the eastern Latvia while Estonian and Lithuanian borders aren’t as secure. If we would unite our defenses on borders into one big defense, it would make it easier for us to hold away any aggressor."
  LAT_Security_Organizations:0 "Security Organizations"
  LAT_Security_Organizations_desc:0 "If we focus more on containing people who might be threat to our nation’s stability, we’ll secure stability in our defenses against enemies in war and we will have more control over our defenses in ministry and army. If we organize proper security measurements, it will be easier for us to appoint army leaders to high roles which will secure our stability."
  LAT_Industrial_Support:0 "Industrial Support"
  LAT_Industrial_Support_desc:0 "One of most important factors in a war is industry. With small amount of factories it will be hard to supply our army in case of emergency and that will lead to bigger fatalities and possibility of failed defense. Our industry isn’t exactly the biggest, we should put our effort into changing that."
  LAT_Border_Fortification:0 "Border Fortification"
  LAT_Border_Fortification_desc:0 "We’ve done everything we could do with our inner security at the moment, but our outside borders aren’t as great. If we concentrate our powers on our borders, it might save our nations independence in the future by not letting enemies getting into our fatherland."
  LAT_Infantry_Focus:0 "Infantry Focus"
  LAT_Infantry_Focus_desc:0 "Our resources are limited, we cannot invest too much into army which we won’t be able to support with the supplies it needs. Infantry is the cheapest type of army and it fits our needs for our combat strategies. With modern and strong infantry army, we will be able to hold away anyone who tries to threaten us."
  LAT_Modern_Equipment:0 "Modern Equipment"
  LAT_Modern_Equipment_desc:0 "We’re on the way on making our military up to date with the latest technological advances in other European nations, but, we need extra funds and more time to do that. Sponsoring our military research will be vital if we get into combat with some other nation. Modern equipment will make our small nation more efficient against bigger armies."
  LAT_Motorized_Divisions:0 "Motorized Divisions"
  LAT_Motorized_Divisions_desc:0 "Our nation may be small but that doesn’t mean that our army doesn’t need some way of transportation. Motorized infantry will be able to be in time to any part of our nation in a short time. It will cost us some resources and may be taught to get started at first, but once our army has more experience, we’ll be able to defend any region, at any time."
  LAT_Armored_Technology:0 "Armored Technology"
  LAT_Armored_Technology_desc:0 "For a more effective motorized division, we need armor. It can be mechanized armor vehicles for our infantry or even tanks. By spending more resources on such technology we will insure more secure and powerful army will be combat ready for any challange."
  LAT_Riga_Defenses:0 "Riga Defenses"
  LAT_Riga_Defenses_desc:0 "Riga is our capital and our most important city in every aspect. By making sure we will be able to defend Riga in case of war, we’re securing the security and independence of our nation and people. By making some defense measurements that fit our army needs, we’ll be able to defend Riga against any potential enemy."
  LAT_Armored_Forces:0 "Armored Forces"
  LAT_Armored_Forces_desc:0 "One of most inspiring things in battlefields is big scary things, which can move and shoot, known as tanks. Having tanks in our army will benefit both our army and will make kids happy seeing them. If we make some factories compatible with mass tank production, we’ll be able to supply our army with our own home made tanks. This will also be vital for our future possible plans with motorized divisions."
  LAT_Zibenskars:0 "Zibenskarš"
  LAT_Zibenskars_desc:0 "Zibenskarš or as the Germans call it Blietzkrieg is somewhat popular tactic used by mobile armies. We’ve been focusing on motorizing our army and introducing bigger tanks. If we would use the Zibenskarš tactics against our enemies, we will be able to overwhelm them in the moments when they don’t expect."
  LAT_Special_Forces:0 "Special Forces"
  LAT_Special_Forces_desc:0 "Sometimes simple infantry division can’t do what you want them to do, but in such case we can have Special Forces which will deal with tasks they’re mastered at. By having Special Forces for some tasks that simple infantry shouldn’t do, we’ll be able to loose less man on the battlefield and have more success at the missions we’ve assigned to the forces."
  LAT_Recruitment_Campaign:0 "Recruitment Campaign"
  LAT_Recruitment_Campaign_desc:0 "Our army is small as it is, so we should try keeping it at a decent size. If we start recruitment campaign, we’ll be able to get more volunteers to join the army. They may not be trained as much as we would like to, but it’s only matter of time. If we will be in any conflict, we’ll have bigger force to defend our land and bigger force to push back the enemy troops."
  LAT_Figther_Focus:0 "Figther Focus"
  LAT_Figther_Focus_desc:0 "Fighters are vital part of controlling the air space over your or enemies land. With new modern fighters we will secure our air space in case of war at any cost. If we invest more time into the VEF plane manufacturer, we will have our own, modern fighters which will patron the sky as part of our air force."
  LAT_Bomber_Focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
  LAT_Bomber_Focus_desc:0 "Bombers are critical air power in a big conflict with other nation. With them it’s possible to bomb enemy’s factories and infrastructure so they will have less power of industry against us. They are also helpful in the battlefield by supporting our troops on land by bombing enemy frontlines."
  LAT_Deal_of_Gladiators:0 "Deal of Gladiators"
  LAT_Deal_of_Gladiators_desc:0 "Despite us concentrating on our own plane production, getting planes from other producers is welcome. United Kingdom is producer of the Gloster Gladiator fighters and they fit our requirements for new planes. They are decently modern and aren’t as expensive as some other alternatives. The only step we need to do now is to request purchase of Gloster Gladiators from the United Kingdom."
  LAT_CAS_Effort:0 "CAS Effort"
  LAT_CAS_Effort_desc:0 "Close Air Support can be lethal in important battles both in defensive and attacking situations. Herberts Cukurs has started developing some aircraft which could fit the role but he’s doing it on his own. If we support such engineers who are willing to research and build new aircraft, we’ll be able to modernize our air force with modern technologies which are home made."
  LAT_NAV_Effort:0 "NAV Effort"
  LAT_NAV_Effort_desc:0 "Sometimes the navy isn’t able to do its missions as easy as with support from the naval bombers. We don’t have any naval bomber prototypes but perhaps it’s good to invest in making some. With naval bombers our small army will be more secure against any enemy naval attacks."
  LAT_Heavy_Fighter_Effort:0 "Heavy Fighter Effort"
  LAT_Heavy_Fighter_Effort_desc:0 "There are some pilots which have shown more interest in heavy fighter development. They claim that with them we’ll be able to control skies for longer time and in a wider distance than with the simple fighter planes which we own right now. It’s unknown how useful they will be for our air space control but perhaps it is worth the investment."
  LAT_Strategic_Bomber_Effort:0 "Strategic Bomber Effort"
  LAT_Strategic_Bomber_Effort_desc:0 "We’ve invested in bombers but we didn’t focus on strategic bombers. With such bombers we would do more damage behind the enemy lines and worsen their supply or even damage their industries. Strategic bombers will benefit our air force and ground force at the biggest point of the war if we ever end up in one."
  LAT_Build_New_Airport:0 "Build New Airport"
  LAT_Build_New_Airport_desc:0 "Our air force currently is located in only one air base and that’s a big risk for our security. It’s easier to bomb the airbase in a war and if we lose the airbase, we don’t have any place for our air force. Having an air base in Kurzeme would be more secure in case of land combat. Even if we lose all of our air force, it will allow our allied air forces to land in Kurzeme rather than Vidzeme or vise versa."
  LAT_Expand_Current_Airport:0 "Expand Current Airport"
  LAT_Expand_Current_Airport_desc:0 "Our current airport is decent but it may need some expansion for our future air force size. We will be able to hold more of our own planes and perhaps some allied planes in there are such situation and need for it. There’s no point in making a separate airbase for our air force, it’s more efficient to have full control over it in one airbase."
  LAT_Destroyer_Effort:0 "Destroyer Effort"
  LAT_Destroyer_Effort_desc:0 "Light ships are big part of our naval power and we could concentrate our powers to make them even more vital. With focusing our own power into light ship development, we’ll be able to make navy which is independent from other nations support. That would be cheaper and more proud way of growing our navy for the future challenges."
  LAT_Trained_Destroyer_Crew:0 "Trained Destroyer Crew"
  LAT_Trained_Destroyer_Crew_desc:0 "With navy mainly based on Light ships, we would want the best of the best to be in the crew of each ship. Each person who joins the naval forces should be taught about everything that there’s to know and more. By improving light ship operator training, we’ll have the best light ship operators."
  LAT_Submarine_Effort:0 "Submarine Effort"
  LAT_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "Submarines are definitely the highlight of our navy and the proudest part of it. But current submarines are made in France. If we would produce our own submarines, it will be easier for us to repair them, and also inspire the Latvian people in our production possibilities."
  LAT_Trained_Submarine_Crew:0 "Trained Submarine Crew"
  LAT_Trained_Submarine_Crew_desc:0 "Operating a submarine is not a small task, and even harder is to make small submarine navy into competitive naval force in the Baltic Sea. Having experienced and well educated submarine operators would benefit our goal at becoming competitive navy in the Baltic Sea. No one knows when you will need a navy which is capable to hold against bigger navies."
  LAT_Revival_of_Karosta:0 "Revival of Karosta"
  LAT_Revival_of_Karosta_desc:0 "Karosta has been important naval base of the Russian Empire. Now day’s it’s not in the greatest shape, but it’s not lost yet. In the past it produced ships, submarines and other kind of naval transportation or equipment, and it should do so now day’s as well."
  LAT_Western_Port_Modernization:0 "Western Port Modernization"
  LAT_Western_Port_Modernization_desc:0 "The ports of Liepāja and Ventspils, unlike Riga port, are actually located on the Baltic Sea, and not the Riga Sea Gulf as the Riga port is. They are also the closest to Germany and other developed European nations. If these two ports would be expanded we would be able to operate more cargo deliveries trough the two cities. "
  LAT_Capital_Port_Modernisation:0 "Capital Port Modernisation"
  LAT_Capital_Port_Modernisation_desc:0 "The port at our capital Riga is the most important in terms of shipments. We’re also able to use it for our military needs better than other ports. If we would expand the Riga port we would be able to base decently big naval power together and have them ready for call to the sea. "
  LAT_Latvian_Battleship_Project:0 "Latvian Battleship Project"
  LAT_Latvian_Battleship_Project_desc:0 "There are never too big dreams to be dreaming about. We believe that someday the Latvian people will be proud of Latvia’s own Battleship. This may cost us a lot of resources and time, but nothing is impossible. This will be a big step for our navy to becoming serious navy concern for other nations on the Baltic Sea."
  LAT_Latvian_Carrier_Project:0 "Latvian Carrier Project"
  LAT_Latvian_Carrier_Project_desc:0 "There’s nothing that is impossible, and we believe that. If we try to put effort into getting our own carrier ship, we might as well build one in the future. With this we will be able to show to other nations that we’re not some joke, and we’ll be able to control the Baltic Sea against any enemy."

  LAT_Land_Forces:0 "Land Forces"
  LAT_Land_Forces_desc:0 "Our land forces have been lacking financial support since the end of independence war. The world is becoming more aggressive and perhaps closer to a major war. We should invest more finances into our land units to make sure we’re ready to defend our borders. Our army needs modernization and new tactics."
  LAT_Air_Forces:0 "Air Forces"
  LAT_Air_Forces_desc:0 "Our air forces have been going outdated for quite a while now. Major nations tend to build modern new models for their own air force. Perhaps we could work with major nations in getting better and more modern planes for our air force. But it’s not all about planes, it’s also about tactics, which we need to work on as well."
  LAT_Sea_Forces:0 "Sea Forces"
  LAT_Sea_Forces_desc:0 "Just like rest of the army our navy is getting outdated. We have ships and submarines that are ready to defend our seas, but to stand against bigger nations, we need bigger navy and more modern watercrafts. We also should work on our naval ports and naval dockyards to be able to support our navy in tougher situations."

  LAT_Demand_Prussia:0 "Demand Prussia"
  LAT_Demand_Prussia_desc:0 "Prussia has been land of the Baltic people for very long time but sadly with crusaders over Europe it was taken away by the Germanic people and our Old Prussian brothers have disappeared duo to Germanisation. We still can demand the land from Germany and if they give it back, we can restore it to its old glory."
