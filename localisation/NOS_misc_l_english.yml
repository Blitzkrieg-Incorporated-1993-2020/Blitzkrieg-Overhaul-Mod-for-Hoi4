Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as [Root.GetLeader] in [Root.Capital.GetName] announced that [CHI.GetName] will follow the fascist path. All oppositions are immediately put to silence in hours.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.18.d_nl:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. [Root.GetLeader] is now calling for a transition into fascism.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by some of the [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but it has angered [Root.GetLeader] greatly. If we do not act now, [Root.GetLeader] may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.10.d_nl:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. [Root.GetLeader] is disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetRulingParty].\n\n[Root.GetLeader] remain certain that the people will eventually pick up their sense of pride, but is hesitating on what course of action to take. Some of the supporters call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

Therefore the search of the Dalai Lama is the most important task of the Regency Government in order to ensure the continuity of the theocratic system. The Regent just convened the Tibetan National Assembly to decide where to search for the Dalai Lama. In this process two elements were essential: signs and omens would give the governments general information on where to look for. Then the visions of the Regent would give more precise information on the location of the next Dalai Lama. He explained that last year, while he was at lake Lhamolatso, he saw the letters "a", "ka" and "ma", a monastery with three-tiered turquoise roof, a gilded pagoda-like top and a twisting trail leading east of this monastery to a bare hill opposite a small one story house with a blue roof. A should mean Amdo (the former Tibetan province in the north-east). This is consistent with the fact that the head of the Dalai Lama turned east after his death. In addition, on the east side of a wooden pillar located in the northeast side of the throneroom, a great star-shaped fungus appeared overnight. In addition, on several different occasions the state oracles Nechung, Gadong, and Samye had flung ceremonial scarves toward the east while in trance. \n\nWhile a part of the assembly is convinced that searching parties must be sent to Amdo, currently under the control of Hui warlords, some, lead by Lönchen Langdün argued that one of his relative, the son of Yabshi Phawpön is the Dalai Lama because one of the horses of the stable of the previous Dalai Lama broke loose and ran to his house, as if he was waiting his master."

There were no openings on the outside walls, except for the doorway. On the roof, there were three chimneys stacks and two air-holes. Around the roof were small gutters with spouts giving out into the courtyard. Over the entrance, there was a socket fixed in the roof to take a 10-foot-high flagpole. \n\nThe search party came there because of the letter "a" seen by the Reting Rinpoche in his vision was referring to the province of Amdo, the letter "ka" certainly meant the monastery of Kumbum. That building was three stories high and roofed by blue tiles, as described by the Regent. The last part of the vision indicated a house with a peculiar tree. Here, finally, they saw a house with a gnarling juniper bush on the flat roof...\n\nIn order to investigate, Kewtsang Rinpoche who was leading the party, disguised himself as a servant while they asked to stay for the night. In it live a couple of peasants and their children, the first one was living at the Kumbum monastery as he had been recognized as the reincarnation of the Taktser Rinpoche.

 himalaya_tibet.31.t:0 "The Resignation of Trimön"
 himalaya_tibet.31.desc:0 "We have finally received the letter of resignation of Trimön. He may have been the leader of the Kashag (assembly) at the time of the death of the 13th Dalai Lama and one of the few who accompanied the Regent on his pilgrimage to the lake of Lhamolatso in the summer of 1935, but Trimön was recently only the shadow of his former self. He may have been arrogant before, but his recent behavior was more closer to madness. One night, he was heard crying and shouting wildly while banging on the wooden door of the Jokhang Temple. That scandal, among other eccentricities lead to an increase pressure in order to obtain his resignation."

 himalaya_tibet.32.t:0 "We have been blackmailed!"
 himalaya_tibet.32.desc:0 "After that the probable candidate was found and escorted to the Monastery of Kumbum, the news spread in the region that the Dalai Lama was there. In that evening armed soldiers arrived at the monastery in order to ensure the security of the child. We now know what happened after the discovery of this very credible candidate but sadly the soldiers won't allow the expedition to go back as a merry procession. Instead they are demanding 100.000 coins of silver in order to free him. It's clear that we are victim of a cruel blackmail and that we have little choices but to agree to those outrageous demands."

 POLITICS_CHAO_KUNG_DESC:0 "Abbot in China, Chao Kung claimed to be the true Dalai Lama and was supported by both Germany and Japan. Few know however that this man is actually Hungarian born Ignaz Trebitsch who was a member of the British Parliament under the name of Trebitsch-Lincoln, worked as a spy for Germany for a while before moving to China, converting to Buddhism and becoming a abbot...all of that before he claimed to be the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama."
 TIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "[FULLY OVERHAULED]\n\nTibet may appear as a very stable isolated semi feudal theocracy, but it is quite far from the truth. A few years ago communist and democratic movements were strongly repressed by the ruling religious and civilian aristocracy. The country must reform its army but at the same time the monasteries fear a modernizing army that would challenge their position. Last but not least the country is ruled by a Regent and the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must be found and crowned in order to perpetuate the theocratic system."
