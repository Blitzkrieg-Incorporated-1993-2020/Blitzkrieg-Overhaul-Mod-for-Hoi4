 political.29.t:0 "Protesting Union Workers across [Root.GetName]"
 political.29.d:0 "For the past few days, Disenfranchised workers across the [ROOT.GetAdjective] countryside have taken to protesting, in some cases violently, in front of their places of employment in response to the percieved transgressions of their superiors. Gaining confidence due to the growth in Syndical, Anarchist, and other Pro-Union Anti-State parties over the past year or so, the actions of these workers are threatening to cut into the productivity of the nation as a whole. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Leftist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.29.a:0 "We must hope that things don't continue to escalate."
 political.30.t:0 "Rioting Proletariat in [Root.GetName]"
 political.30.d:0 "'You are naught but a cog in a machine! A machine that is made to serve it's and our masters, the elite, and not you, the humble worker. Your life is expendable to them, and if they were forced to choose between you and their profits your existence would be deemed unnecessary. Their profits are so important to them that they have sat back and done nothing as our toils worsen, and as our cries of rage and pain grow louder! Join your Union Brothers!'\n\nThese and other such things are being spouted, as men, women, and even children take to the streets, causing mass havok in major cities across the nation. This is looking like the beginning of a violent revolution, and, while it does seem to be dying down, the damage caused will likely be a detriment to the economy for the forseeable future."
 political.30.a:0 "This isn't solving anything!"
 political.31.t:0 "Socialists Demand Referendum"
 political.31.d:0 "Leftist ideas of a less agressive nature than that of Marx and his contemporaries have been a backwater in [Root.GetAdjective] politics as long as they have been present, but recent events and some lucky breaks on the part of unions and pro-union parties have propelled said interest groups to a place of prominence in our nation. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more radical leftists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed, and one of their Pro-Worker parties put in charge of total reorganization. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular leftist method of removal: Riot and Revolution."
 political.31.c:0 "I suppose [Root.GetRulingParty] must step aside..."
 political.32.t:0 "Leftists Move on Seat of Government"
 political.32.d:0 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at gaining their 'rights' peacefully, the Unionist parties have apparently organized a mass protest that has, according to rumours, changed its goals in the last few hours. The mob was originally moving in on the city center, but now it, spearheaded by prominent politicians, loyal celebrities, and thousands of indoctronated citizens, appears to be making its way towards the buildings that house the seat of government. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has made the decision to assume the worst, which isn't unfeasible given that many in the mob are armed, and proceed under the pretense that this will erupt in violence. They will fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 political.32.a:0 "They must be stopped in their tracks!"
 political.32.b:0 "All we seek is justice for the common man!"
 political.33.t:0 "Rioting Dies Down"
 political.33.d:0 "After a time of great chaos in major cities across the country, the massive riots that began several months ago has dissapeared entirely, and the damages caused by the riots have mostly either been repaired or midigated. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if the desired economic and workplace reforms were to take place.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 political.33.a:0 "Time to resume the work of state."

 political.34.t:0 "Rising Popularity for Monarchy"
 political.34.d:0 "Over the last few months, rising sentiment in our nation for the establishment of a monarchy and a class of nobility has taken place. Prominent military personnel, politicians, celebrities, average citizens, and especially the elites of the nation can be seen amongst the ranks of those criticizing the current government and advocating for a return to traditional autocracy. The government has yet to comment on these developments, though some of the more agitative of the monarchists say that their lack of comment is, in itself, an answer as to their standing on the issues at hand. More information as developments continue."
 political.34.a:0 "That sounds like a step in the wrong direction."
 political.35.t:0 "The New Nobility in [Root.GetName]"
 political.35.d:0 "Many wealthy benefactors, intelectuals, and politicans of a more traditional disposition announced the creation of their own new class in our society earlier this week, styling themselves as the "New Nobility". While the government has stated that they are within their bounds to take these actions, they've also made it clear that they are within their right as a state to deny any supposed "rights of the nobility" that this new group attempts to proclaim. Property that was under company ownership, ollective ownership, or political administration of members of the New Nobility has since been proclaimed as their private property, thus enabling them as nobles with land to own and do with as they see fit. Socialist and Communist elements within the nation are infuriated, and many more republican elements within the state are similarly upset by the current administration's seeming unwillingness to limit the power of the wealthy and powerful elites."
 political.35.a:0 "Excuse Me?!"
 political.36.t:0 "The People and New Nobility Demand Referendum"
 political.36.d:0 "Leftist ideas of a less agressive nature than that of Marx and his contemporaries have been a backwater in [Root.GetAdjective] politics as long as they have been present, but recent events and some lucky breaks on the part of unions and pro-union parties have propelled said interest groups to a place of prominence in our nation.

 political.36.c:0 "I suppose [Root.GetRulingParty] must step aside..."
 political.37.t:0 "The New Nobility Takes Up Arms"
 political.37.d:0 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at gaining their 'rights' peacefully, the Unionist parties have apparently organized a mass protest that has, according to rumours, changed its goals in the last few hours. The mob was originally moving in on the city center, but now it, spearheaded by prominent politicians, loyal celebrities, and thousands of indoctronated citizens, appears to be making its way towards the buildings that house the seat of government.

 political.37.b:0 "All we seek is justice for the common man!"
 political.38.t:0 "Monarchist Sympathies Waning"
 political.38.d:0 "After a time of great chaos in major cities across the country, the massive riots that began several months ago has dissapeared entirely, and the damages caused by the riots have mostly either been repaired or midigated. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if the desired economic and workplace reforms were to take place.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly.

 political.38.a:0 "Time to resume the work of state."
 
 political.39.t:0 "Military Takeover"
 political.39.d:0 "Having seen nothing but political stagnation and national degradation over the last few years, a section of the military has taken it upon themselves to march on the capital of our nation and 'restore order' as they put it when they announced their intentions last night. As of now, they are taking power and rearranging the political balance of the nation."
 political.39.a:0 "This shall not stand!"
 political.39.b:0 "Order must be restored at any cost!"

 genericfocustree.1.desc:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]Following initial tests, the politicians of [From.GetName] have decided to direct [From.GetAdjective] research towards the development of nuclear technology. The technology is still highly experimental, and there is great uncertainty whether it has any practical applications at all. Who knows where this might lead their war effort."
 genericfocustree.1.a:0 "We should follow this development."
 genericfocustree.2.title:0 "[From.GetName] offers aid"

 genericfocustree.3.desc:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]During a declamatory speech, [From.From.GetLeader] has announced to the world that [From.GetName] will devote the bulk of its efforts to opposing communism. After describing it as destabilising, oppressive and the true enemy of democracy, [From.From.GetLeader] finished his speech by announcing plans of creating or joining an anti-communist initiative. So far no communist nations have responded."
 genericfocustree.3.a:0 "A bold move."
 genericfocustree.4.title:0 "[From.GetName] announces new communist initiative"
 genericfocustree.4.desc:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon][From.From.GetLeader] has issued a surprising declaration that surprised the world, decrying the doctrine of Marx, Trotsky and Stalin as all incorrect. Instead they have announced a separate form of communism, one that they adhere to. Apparently it is also the only 'true' form of communism. This action has made them rather unpopular on the world stage."
 genericfocustree.4.a:0 "Realistically, what is the difference?"
 genericfocustree.5.title:0 "[From.GetName] announces Permanent Revolution"
 genericfocustree.5.desc:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon][From.From.GetLeader] has today declared that the 'permanent revolution' begins today. Whilst they did not exactly outline what that meant, experts believe that this is the beginning of their concerted effort to spread communism throughout the world, however is the most effective manner. The world waits to see what [From.GetName] does next."
 genericfocustree.5.a:0 "Glad I'm not next to them."
 genericfocustree.6.title:0 "[From.GetName] Announces Initiative"
 genericfocustree.6.desc:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]In a odd speech, the pragmatic [From.From.GetLeader] has delivered a message to all those nations who have no ideological alignment, that they should consider working together. It seems that [From.From.GetLeader] is not as ideologically stringent as many thought he was, as he may be finding some new, strange allies. The Protective Initiative, (as [From.From.GetLeader] named it) will be beginning shortly, and all minor nations are welcomed."
 genericfocustree.6.a:0 "How bizarre."
 genericfocustree.7.title:0 "[From.GetName] offers alliance"
 genericfocustree.7.desc:0 "[From.From.GetLeader] has offered you an alliance, in order for you to be protected. It seems like a generous offer, but we must first make sure we are not walking into a trap."

 genericfocustree.10.desc:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]Today, [From.From.GetLeader] has announced that the previous regime has peacefully transitioned into democracy through the enabling elections and mass resignation. A new, democratic government has taken power and intends to make sweeping reforms to completely liberalise [From.GetName]. The democracies of the world have gained a new ally with seeming convert's zeal."
 genericfocustree.10.a:0 "Interesting."
 genericfocustree.11.title:0 "[From.From.GetLeader] crowned Emperor of the [From.GetAdjective] Empire"
 genericfocustree.11.desc:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]In a lavish ceremony, [From.From.GetLeader] has been officially crowned the Emperor of the [From.GetAdjective] Empire. Whilst some blow this off as merely a party within a part of the world that no one is interested in, others see this as an opportunity to gain an ally, or an ideological enemy. The motives of the new Emperor will only be reveal in time."
 genericfocustree.11.a:0 "By what right do they become emperor?"
 genericfocustree.12.title:0 "[From.GetName] exports communism to us"
 genericfocustree.12.desc:0 "[From.GetName] has started to send partisan communists into our country as a means of seeding a communist revolution."

The fate of Western Europe hangs in the balance of one decision - Shall we create an Alliance to Oppose Stalin and his agressive actions in Asia and Western Europe?

 austria.1117.t:0 "Austria-Hungary demands Transylvania"
 austria.1117.d:0 "Austria-Hungary has been making statements amongst its own people and ours about the importance of Transylvania to the Hungarian people. If we are to avoid war, it has come to the breakpoint - do we cede Transylvania?"
 austria.1117.a:0 "Transylvania is rightfully ours!"
 austria.1117.b:0 "If we go to war, they will just take everything."
 
 austria.1118.t:0 "Romania has yielded"
 austria.1118.d:0 "The Romanians have displayed unusual wisdom in ceding Transylvania as demanded. The local governmental infrastructure is already being transferred to our control, and we can move troops in as needed."
 austria.1118.a:0 "Perfect."
 
 austria.1119.t:0 "Romania has denied us"
 austria.1119.d:0 "It seems the upstart Romanians have forgotten to whom Transylvania belongs. War with them is absolutely justified; but is it the time?"
 austria.1119.a:0 "The fools. Mobilise the troops."
 austria.1119.b:0 "War is inopportune right now. Another time."
 
 austria.1122.t:0 "Transylvania is ours"
 austria.1122.d:0 "Transylvania is ours, and we have the opportunity to force an advantageous peace to keep the land we have demanded. This war has already claimed too many lives; should we force a peace deal?"
 austria.1122.a:0 "This war is pointless now."
 austria.1122.b:0 "Push to Bucharest!"
 
 austria.1124.t:0 "The Romanian Question"
 austria.1124.d:0 "The Romanian majority in Transylvania has, despite being largely peaceful, kept up a stiff political resistance to Hungarian rule. This is unacceptable. If the majority won't accept their rule, we will make them a minority."
 austria.1124.a:0 "Remove them."
 austria.1124.b:0 "Perhaps a bridge too far."
 
 austria.1125.t:0 "Austria demands Slovenia"
 austria.1125.d:0 "The Austrian government has been applying political pressure of late for the region of Slovenia. War with them may be costly, but can we afford to cede land so easily?"
 austria.1125.a:0 "If it spares the lives of our people, yes."
 austria.1125.b:0 "Never! Yugoslavia will defend its own!"
 
 austria.1126.t:0 "Yugoslavia cedes Slovenia"
 austria.1126.d:0 "The Yugoslavians have wisely ceded the land we have demanded, granting our troops complete access, as well as control of any and all facilities. Our plans proceed as required."
 austria.1126.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1127.t:0 "Yugoslavia refused our demands"
 austria.1127.d:0 "The upstart false-nation of Yugoslavia seems to want to fight back against us. What other explanation could we have for so rude a refusal? We will have to take back what is ours."
 austria.1127.a:0 "Then it seems we have no choice."
 
 austria.1128.t:0 "Austria demands former territories"
 austria.1128.d:0 "Austrian aggressions have come to a head, and they now demand the northern territories of Yugoslavia for their own purposes. They are an intimidating power - but should we concede?"
 austria.1128.a:0 "We will defend our own land!"
 austria.1128.b:0 "We cannot face a war with Austria."
 
 austria.1129.t:0 "Yugoslavia refuses our demands"
 austria.1129.d:0 "The pretender state of Yugoslavia has denied us the land we have every right to. We can go to war at this very moment, but is it the opportune moment?"
 austria.1129.a:0 "We will take what we need."
 austria.1129.b:0 "Now is not the time."
 
 austria.1130.t:0 "Yugoslavia cedes the Northern Balkans"
 austria.1130.d:0 "Yugoslavia recognizes that they cannot face a war with our superior military, and has ceded their northern lands to us. We are already installing our own political agents."
 austria.1130.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 austria.1131.t:0 "Our goals have been met"
 austria.1131.d:0 "We have taken all the ground we demanded from Yugoslavia, and now their desperate defensive forces are grasping at straws for any way out - including a ceasefire. We can enforce this now, but is it the best option?"
 austria.1131.a:0 "Now is not the time for overlong wars."
 austria.1131.b:0 "We can and will take all they have!"
 
 austria.1132.t:0 "Remilitarization of Serbia"
 austria.1132.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Yugoslavian war, our armies have gained tactical access to deeper regions of Serbia. Onwards!"
 austria.1132.a:0 "Just as planned!"
 
 austria.1133.t:0 "Austria requests Slovakia"
 austria.1133.d:0 "The Austrian government has made a request that the occupied region of Slovakia is transferred to their control, in light of its ancestral heritage as Austro-Hungarian land."
 austria.1133.a:0 "This seems reasonable."
 austria.1133.b:0 "It was Austrian, and is now German."
 
 austria.1138.t:0 "Germany has given us Slovakia"
 austria.1138.d:0 "The German government has come to the consensus that we are deserving of a stake in the Slovakian region. They have transferred control of all facilities to us and we are free to make use of the land in any way necessary."
 austria.1138.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1139.t:0 "Germany has withheld Slovakia"
 austria.1139.d:0 "Germany has denied our request for the Slovakian region. A sad state of affairs, but surely we will have our day in time."
 austria.1139.a:0 "An unfortunate setback."
 
 austria.1140.t:0 "Austria requests Krakow"
 austria.1140.d:0 "Austria has requested the Polish region of Krakow, which has long been contested between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Poland. Their claim is just - but will we grant it?"
 austria.1140.a:0 "Of course."
 austria.1140.b:0 "This does not suit our needs."
 
 austria.1141.t:0 "Germany has given us Krakow"
 austria.1141.d:0 "Germany has ceded access to the region of Krakow, granting us access to another ancient center of Austro-Hungarian heritage."
 austria.1141.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1142.t:0 "Germany has withheld Krakow"
 austria.1142.d:0 "Germany has denied us Krakow, retaining access of the city and denying us ancient Austro-Hungarian land. A questionable decision, for sure."
 austria.1142.a:0 "Questionable, but implacable."
 
 austria.1143.t:0 "Dalmatia for South Tyrol"
 austria.1143.d:0 "The political machinations of Italy gained us a part of Tyrol after the Great War. The Austrians intend to reclaim the territory in time - and we intend to claim Dalmatia. Perhaps an agreement can be reached...?"
 austria.1143.a:0 "It seems to be necessary."
 austria.1143.b:0 "We will cede them nothing!"
 
 austria.1144.t:0 "Italy has agreed to our deal"
 austria.1144.d:0 "The Italians have accepted our offer, agreeing to move their troops out of Dalmatia as we move ours out of Tyrol. The exchange is effective immediately."
 austria.1144.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 austria.1145.t:0 "Italy has refused our deal"
 austria.1145.d:0 "The Italians have decided that their claim over the Italian majority in Dalmatia is worth more than their dubious claim to the rest of Tyrol. They have refused our offer."
 austria.1145.a:0 "Perhaps for the best."
 
 austria.1146.t:0 "Austria demands the Istrian Peninsula"
 austria.1146.d:0 "The Austrians have demanded the Istrian peninsula, a stronghold of Austro-Hungarian naval superiority since before the Great War. Denying them could mean consequences."
 austria.1146.a:0 "They are too dangerous a power to deny."
 austria.1146.b:0 "We can deal with consequences."
 
 austria.1147.t:0 "Italy has ceded Istria"
 austria.1147.d:0 "Italy has ceded the old naval stronghold of Istria to us, effective immediately. Our troops are free to reclaim it."
 austria.1147.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 austria.1148.t:0 "Italy has refused our demands"
 austria.1148.d:0 "The Italians have foolishly stood up to us. Perhaps it is time we show the upstarts that beating us once does not guarantee victory again."
 austria.1148.a:0 "Are they prepared for war?"
 
 austria.1149.t:0 "Austrian invitation"
 austria.1149.d:0 "The Austrian government has extended an invitation to a military alliance headed by their own empire. A powerful ally to have - but do we need their help?"
 austria.1149.a:0 "Any help in these unstable times is welcome."
 austria.1149.b:0 "We can forge our own way."
 
 austria.1150.t:0 "Austrian Ultimatum"
 austria.1150.d:0 "Austria has delivered an ultimatum to us - to come under the dominion of the Österreich Imperium, or to be brought under Austrian dominion forcefully. We are placed in a difficult position."
 austria.1150.a:0 "We will protect our citizens' way of life!"
 austria.1150.b:0 "It seems we must accept Austrian leadership."
 
 austria.1151.t:0 "Greece has refused our ultimatum"
 austria.1151.d:0 "The impudent Greeks have delivered a stinging slap to the face, denying our offer of political and military protection. Such an overt gesture is absolutely an act of war!"
 austria.1151.a:0 "And we will treat it as such!"
 
 austria.1152.t:0 "Greece has succumbed to our ultimatum"
 austria.1152.d:0 "Greece has wisely accepted our offer of protection in these dark and troubled times. Their government has changed hands with minimal fuss to our control and they will operate as part of our coalition."
 austria.1152.a:0 "The wiser choice to make."
 
 austria.1153.t:0 "Austrian invitation"
 austria.1153.d:0 "Our old allies, the Austrians, have extended an arm in friendship, offering a resurrection of the old Central Powers. Perhaps it is time to rejoin with our old Ottoman allies?"
 austria.1153.a:0 "If there is any time, it is now."
 austria.1153.b:0 "We must consider our allies more carefully, if a war is coming."
 
 austria.1154.t:0 "Turkey has agree to join us"
 austria.1154.d:0 "Turkey has accepted our offer of alliance, and stands with us in any future conflict. The Ottomans have not forgotten their friends!"
 austria.1154.a:0 "And neither have we."
 
 austria.1155.t:0 "Turkey has refused to join us"
 austria.1155.d:0 "Turkey, it seems, has forgotten how loyally we stood by each other in the Great War. They have denied our alliance, and will go their own way."
 austria.1155.a:0 "A troubling concept."
 
 austria.1156.t:0 "We have beaten back the Soviets"
 austria.1156.d:0 "The Ukranian uprising has been going well, relatively, speaking, and yet the Soviet bear is still a worrying presence above us. We can keep pushing if we believe we can take more ground - or we can deliver a peace deal."
 austria.1156.a:0 "We will offer peace - with conditions."
 austria.1156.b:0 "The Soviets cannot be allowed to continue!"
 
 austria.1157.t:0 "The Ukrainian Armistice"
 austria.1157.d:0 "The Austrians have delivered a peace deal. Considering how the war has been going, the terms are generous - an immediate ceasefire, in exchange for freedom for the Russian Ukraine. Should we accept?"
 austria.1157.a:0 "It seems necessary."
 austria.1157.b:0 "Not until the last man is dead!"
 
 austria.1158.t:0 "The Soviets have conceded"
 austria.1158.d:0 "The Soviets have accepted a ceasefire. The Ukraine is in the hands of the Ukrainians, and the Ukranians are very grateful to us. A major victory."
 austria.1158.a:0 "And another step in our plans."
 
 austria.1159.t:0 "The Soviets have refused"
 austria.1159.d:0 "The Soviets have decided that their interests are better served by a long, grinding war. Evidence of the true Soviet view of the value of the worker, perhaps?"
 austria.1159.a:0 "For the sake of our own, we will end this quickly."
 
 austria.1160.t:0 "We have achieved our goals"
 austria.1160.d:0 "The Ukranian uprising has gone well, and a free Ukranian state is now a possibility. We can deliver a peace deal to the Soviets - peace, for Ukranian freedom. A more reasonable offer, we could not make."
 austria.1160.a:0 "Anything to bring democracy to the Ukraine."
 austria.1160.b:0 "The Soviets cannot be trusted to remain peaceful."

A strong, stubborn man, Jonge was firmly opposed to local autonomy and was also firmly pro-Dutch in his administration, rejecting most efforts to increase colonial autonomy.

Fueled by the rising power of Japan and the growing modernisation of the colony, native figures have arisen championing Independence under many banners. From the East, the fascist pro-Japanese champion the Right of Nationhood, the workers demand greater control over the fruits of their labour, and even the most sympathetic politicans are demanding a true democratic government. Whether the overburdened and undersupported colonial government will be able to quell these demands, or fall under wave of Independence, only time will tell."

Now, Barclay stands virtually unapposed for re-election, with only former President King's Unit Whigs showing any opposition whatsoever. It is not unusual for us to meddle in elections, former President King himself held an election so fraudulent that even other countries called him out on it.

The previous film published was "The Lion has Wings", a movie about the RAF raid on the Kiel Canal, drew such anger that Mexican cinemas were forced to remove the movie. William Jenkins, as far as we know, did nothing expressly wrong if pro-UK films were unpopular with Mexcian audiences.

It is obvious that Maximino is using his leverage over Jenkins to stop non-fascist influence from gaining a foothold in Mexico. Pro-UK movies however are extremely unpopular with Mexican audiences and prompted Mexican cinemas to stop showing them in some instances. The decision to allow pro-UK movies would please the United Kingdom, but not the Mexican movie goer.

Díaz was found unconscious, intoxicated, and suffered blunt force trauma. Diaz later died from his injuries at Los Angeles General Hospital. Police scoured the city for the culprits and arrested the leader of the 1th street gang, Hank Leyvas, his girlfriend Dora Barrios, and 1 other Mexican-Americans out of 600 Mexican Americans rounded up by LAPD. Hank denies any tie to the murder. Tensions have been running high in Los Angeles between Angelenos and Pachucos, otherwise known as zoot suiters, and it seems the tensions won't be resolved any time soon."

They found a party near the site of the attack, and assuming it was a rival gang they confronted the partiers. A fight broke out between the gang and the partiers, lasting about 10 minutes. By morning, the body of Diaz was found. The coronor report states that Dia'z injuries are consistent with being hit by a car. The prosecution put forward E. Duran Ayres, chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, to state that Mexicans as a whole are bloodthirsty and contain a biological urge to kill past down from their Aztec ancestors."

Servicemen were seen raiding bars theaters and cafes to drag out Mexican youths, some of them children, to be stripped naked and beaten as their clothes were burned. A smaller mob has descended on the Black neighborhood of Watts, but there is no word on the scale of the damage done there.

Almazán is known more for being a noted businessman rather than a military figure, and draws in support mainly from wealthy Mexicans. However, his support among the working poor is abysmal as he is seen as offering nothing to them. Almazán's foreign policy is noticeably pro-US and further alianates average Mexicans. Amaro however is a famous military figure, and draws respect from the nationalists. Despite this, Almazán is seen as the inevitable choice for the right wing candidacy and Amaro's bid is quickly losing support to Almazán's campaign through a series of high profile defections. It is clear that Amaro will inevitably lose as Juan is backed by US interests and people find voting for a candidate that the US would try to overthrow is a fool's errand. However, there are people among the fascist cabal in Mexican politics who want to ensure that Almazán never lives to see election day.

Previously, Almazán was attacked by assassins wearing sarapes that hid machine guns while staying at the house of Fransisco Barbosa. His campaign claims he was attacked by an army of 100 assassins, and that he had to be stopped from running outside to fight them.

 NOS_iran.14.d:0 "The brigade was originally formed by Naser Al-Din Shah in 1879, in spite of it's of name, the brigade was not a usual Cossack brigade, it was based on a feudal-style system in which militairy service was rewarded with private strips of land.\n\nThe second major event the Cossack Brigade played a role in was the 1906 Constitutional Revolution, as a result of intense political pressure and rebellion. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah gave in to the rebels, and died shortly after signing the Constitution. It was the Persian Cossack Brigade that helped keeping his son Muhammad Ali Shah on the throne. As a consequence however, he was considered to be a Russian puppet. He later attempted to overthrow the government established by the Constitution using the Persian Cossack Brigade in January 1907. It surrounded the Majles (parliament) and shelled the building with heavy artillery. He was briefly successful and with the help of Colonel Liakhov, the Brigade commander, he governed Tehran for a year acting as a military dictator. Liakhov was appointed military governor of Tehran. In the ensuing civil strife forces from Azerbaijan led by Sattar Khan and Yeprem Khan retook Tehran from the Cossack Brigade, it forced the Shah to abdicate. Here the Brigade failed in ensuring the power of the Shah. Nonetheless the Brigade retained a great deal of importance as a tool for both the Russians and the Shah.\n\nOn 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan led his 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade based in Qazvin and Hamadan to Tehran in 1921 and seized the capital. With this coup Reza Khan established himself as the most powerful person in NOS_iran. The coup was largely bloodless and faced little resistance. Reza Khan's later modernization and enlargement of the army would utilise the Cossack Brigade as its core. Prior to World War I the Cossack Brigade constituted, together with the Swedish trained gendarmerie, the only truly professional military forces in NOS_iran. With his expanded forces and the Cossack Brigade, Reza Khan launched military actions to eliminate separatist and dissident movements in Tabriz, Mashhad, and the Jangalis in Gilan, Simko and the Kurds. The Brigade, with a strength of 7,000-8,000 men at the time, was merged with the gendarmerie and other forces to form the new Iranian Army of 40,000 which would be led by Iranian officers, many of them friends and cronies of Reza Khan from his days as an officer in the Cossack Brigade. These officers from the Cossack brigade received appointments and patronage in key positions in the new government and military. Using the Cossack Brigade as a springboard, Reza Khan found himself able to place himself in a position of power, centralizing the country, removing the Shah and crown himself as new Shah, thus establishing the Pahlavi Dynasty. He was then called Reza Shah."

They claim that duo to historic situations Lithuanian people are the owners of the area and that they finally want it back.

  latvia.120.d:0 "Poland has officially declined our demand to give us control of Vilnius and big parts of Poland which historically were under Lithuanian rule. This was expected from such foolish nation as Poland who doesn’t see threat in us. We can fight for the land if it’s needed! But there’s also other option available… We can organize a compromise, sure we would get less land and resources, but at least we would control Vilnius if they agree to it."

  latvia.126.t:0 "Germany refuses to return Prussia."
  latvia.126.d:0 "We’re outraged that Germany has declined our demand returning us Prussia! The old German Teutonic Order has killed of our old brothers, the old Prussians, and now they refuse to give back the land to the Baltic people! If we have to we’re ready to fight for our old brother land, it’s our culture and our territory, and we shall protect it."

Latvia has a small air force and they’re trying to improve it and make it compatible with other nation forces, and as part of improvement they wish to buy some planes produced by us."
  latvia.127.a:0 "Deal"
  latvia.127.b:0 "No Deal"
  latvia.128.t:0 "United Kingdom accepts the deal."
  latvia.128.d:0 "We’re pleased to announce that United Kingdom has agreed to sell some Gloster Gladiator fighters to our air force. They’re also ready to negotiate with the amount that we want to order, we’ve requested them with 26 but they’re ready to change the amount up to 100 planes. Will 26 new planes be enough or does our air force deserve more?"
  latvia.128.a:0 "We're happy with the deal"
  latvia.128.b:0 "Order 24 more Gladiators"
  latvia.128.c:0 "Order 74 more Gladiators"
  latvia.129.t:0 "United Kingdom declines the deal."
  latvia.129.d:0 "We’re disappointed to announce that United Kingdom has not agreed to sell some Gloster Gladiator fighters to our air force. The reasoning behind this decision is unknown to us, but it’s a failed agreement for our air force. It may been better to invest this time into producing our own planes than ordering from someone else."
  latvia.129.a:0 "That's disapointing"
