 uk_edward_viii:0 "Edward VIII"
 uk_edward_viii_desc:0 "Edward VIII now reigns as King of the United Kingdom & her Dominions, Emperor of India and ruler of the British Empire. Outspoken, brash and defiant of tradition, he is expected to guide Britain down a different path to that which has been tread in the past."
 uk_edward_german_visit:0 "State visit to Germany"
 uk_edward_german_visit_desc:0 "In a move that many see as interfering in the government's foreign policy towards Germany's actions on the continent, the King has taken a one-week visit to Germany, meeting Adolf Hitler and being recieved with a royal welcome."
 uk_appeasement_broadcast:0 "The Appeasement Broadcast"
 uk_appeasement_broadcast_desc:0 "Further breaking recent tradition with his outspoken behaviour, the King has given an unusually unguarded and personal interview with BBC news, in which he argues, as a soldier of the last war, for peace on the continent at any cost. While infuriating Whitehall, the King's attitude has proven popular on the streets, with many Britons uneager to die for another European War."
 uk_splendid_isolation:0 "Splendid Isolation"
 uk_splendid_isolation_desc:0 "Under pressure from the increasingly outspoken King and the populace behind him, the government has taken a drastic policy shift, pledging neutrality on continental affairs. Splendid Isolation, it would seem, is back."

 uk_troublesome_brother_desc:0 "Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor, his abortive reign long since over, has continued to prove an issue. Personal relations between the Duke and the King grow more strained, while pro-Nazi feelings are a growing issue with the cooling Anglo-German relations. To keep him out of trouble's way and stimy any potential German intrigue, it is suggested we send him to the Bahamas where he can rule as Governor."
 uk_kings_speech:0 "The King's Speech"
 uk_kings_speech_desc:0 "Once again, we find ourselves on the other side of the blade from the hun. Hitler's appetite for conquest has reached an unacceptable level, and the civilised nations of Europe are in arms against him and his revanchist Germany. It is time for the whole nation to come behind this war effort, and what better way to rally support than a speech to the Royal subjects from the British Sovereign."
 uk_the_rock:0 "The Rock"

Even as bombs batter the East End, the King & the Royal Family remain in Buckingham Palace, facing the bombs along with their subjects - this a war of all of Britain, not just the common man. We shall prevail, come what may."

 uk_royal_mandate_desc:0 "The sovereign, Edward VIII, is a not only the popular and revered King-Emperor of the British Empire, but a sympathiser to our cause, sharing many of our views and sees the need to remain out of any conflicts in Europe. A royal mandate for a fascist government would propel us into power near-instantly!" 
 uk_march_london:0 "March on London"

 uk_trade_unions:0 "Revolutionary Trade Unions"

 uk_seize_colonies:0 "Seize French Colonies"

 uk_oil_bund_desc:0 "Oil is a resource any Empire on the move needs in the modern era, and while our sources in the colonies across the sea provide for now, it would be goood to develop an economic relationship with oil-rich Romania, to whom we are already allied."

 colonial_communism_desc:0 "The changes the Europeans have brought to our country will never go away; industrialisation, modernisation, capitalism, all of these now mire our land forever.

AUS_repeal_the_abolition_of_nobility_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Great War, the core of our heritage was ripped from us with the abolition of nobility. However, undoing this law will be simpler than previously thought."

AUS_propose_the_alps_defence_pact:0 "Propose the Alps Defence Pact"
AUS_propose_the_alps_defence_pact_desc:0 "The Italians have taken some of our most key strategic locations from us and displaced thousands of our citizens by absorbing Istria and South Tyrol in the wake of the Great War. Now, however, Europe simmers again with tension, and their position relative to us cannot be ignored - or their potential use as an ally."
AUS_propose_the_alps_defence_pact_tt:0 "If Italy accepts, will bypass the Anschluss.\nWe will also recieve §Y300 Light Tanks§!.\n"

AUS_repeal_ban_on_political_parties:0 "Repeal Ban on Political Parties"
AUS_repeal_ban_on_political_parties_desc:0 "The fascists who presently control our country have shortsightedly banned all political parties and the assembly thereof. This ban is not so widely-supported, however, that it cannot be overturned with a little shrewd political maneuvering."

AUS_reinstate_the_habsburg_family:0 "Reinstate the Habsburg Family"
AUS_reinstate_the_habsburg_family_desc:0 "After the end of the Great War, the Habsburgs, the rightful rulers of Austria-Hungary, were stripped of all lands and titles and exiled. These steps were taken under duress; however, the only thing the Habsburgs ever did wrong to us was to lose the war in the first place. They have ever been loyal to us, and so we shall be loyal to them."

AUS_liechtenstein_treaty:0 "Liechtenstein Treaty"
AUS_liechtenstein_treaty_desc:0 "Germany has ceased to be a responsible world power ruled by a steadying and powerful kaiser. Instead, the madman Hitler threatens all of Europe with his expansionist policies. Austria must look to all possible allies if we are to survive - Switzerland included."

AUS_ban_the_national_socialist_party:0 "Arrest the National Socialist Party"
AUS_ban_the_national_socialist_party_desc:0 "The Nazis are a political powerhouse here in Austria as well as in Germany. However, their message to Austria is not one that aligns with our interests. In fact, one might argue that it is treason. Shall we act accordingly?"

AUS_undermine_mussolini:0 "Undermine Mussolini"
AUS_undermine_mussolini_desc:0 "Not all of Italy is united under Mussolini's ideals, as much as he would like for that to be the case. A little political support from our own royalists may increase royalist support in Italy and oust the fascist regime."

AUS_issue_emergency_powers:0 "Issue Emergency Powers"
AUS_issue_emergency_powers_desc:0 "The situation in Europe becomes more tense and volatile with every passing day. In times such as this, the only solution to the threat of our proactive and expansionist neighbors is to do away with bureaucracy and grant similarly proactive powers to our own leaders."

AUS_for_kaiser_and_fatherland:0 "For Kaiser and Fatherland"
AUS_for_kaiser_and_fatherland_desc:0 "It is a time of change for Europe, and Austria's place in the world to come will be determined by the willingness of both state and people to sacrifice. It is time for every able-bodied man to step forward, for Kaiser and fatherland."

AUS_issue_the_venetia_treaty:0 "Issue the Venetia Treaty"
AUS_issue_the_venetia_treaty_desc:0 ""

AUS_italian_civil_war:0 "Italian Civil War"
AUS_italian_civil_war_desc:0 "Italy is in a fragile state. Their king is well-loved and the royalist faction is strong, even if the fascists would have us believe that no other political force exists. A little push will be all it takes to plunge Italy into a civil war."

AUS_demand_sudtyrol:0 "Demand Sudtyrol and Istria"
AUS_demand_sudtyrol_desc:0 "With Italy in a state of pitched civil war, we are in an excellent position to reclaim South Tyrol and Istria. A little political leverage will save us from having to exercise a lot of military leverage."

AUS_interfere_in_italian_civil_war:0 "Offer Assistance for Sudtyrol and Istria"
AUS_interfere_in_italian_civil_war_desc:0 "The righteous royalists now fight to restore their king to true power. Our own Habsburg ruling family looks on their struggle with sympathy - and senses opportunity. Perhaps a bargain can be struck, and an ally won, all in the same moment."

AUS_old_ties:0 "Old Ties"
AUS_old_ties_desc:0 "The ties that bind Austria and Hungary are deep and powerful, and no argument need be made for the restoration of an alliance between them. An alliance between us will help us recover our place in the world better than any rearmament or treaty with another power."

AUS_assassination_of_horthy:0 "Assassination of Horthy"
AUS_assassination_of_horthy_desc:0 "'King Horthy', as he has pretentiously called himself, was once a mere military officer. He now pretends to the throne of Hungary, a claim which is essentially laughable. He has power, however, in spite of this. A simple, if volatile, solution would be to assassinate him so the Habsburgs can step in."

AUS_stabilise_hungary:0 "Stabilise Hungary"
AUS_stabilise_hungary_desc:0 "Hungary is within our domain once again, but the instability that came with Horthy's assassination has caused problems. Time and effort must be put into restoring order."

AUS_the_czech_plan:0 "The Czech Plan"
AUS_the_czech_plan_desc:0 "The former nation of Czechoslovakia, a part of Austria-Hungary of old, is now under German occupation. The region is locked under martial law, but leverage from us could plunge it into the kind of uprising that we need to regain the region for ourselves without war with Hitler."

AUS_path_of_war:0 "Path of War"
AUS_path_of_war_desc:0 "Germany has taken from us our territories to the north in Czechoslovakia. We, of course, plan to take this land back. The path of war is the only way forward."

AUS_path_of_peace:0 "Path of Peace"
AUS_path_of_peace_desc:0 "Germany has annexed our old territory of Czechoslovakia, but that does not place Austro-Hungarian people out of our reach. Preparations can still be made to bring our people into our borders."

AUS_arm_czech_resistance:0 "Arm the Czech Resistance"
AUS_arm_czech_resistance_desc:0 "Germany may control Czechoslovakia, but we can still put more than one spanner in their works; one concept is a proxy war, fought by funding the Czech resistance."

AUS_czech_immigration:0 "Czech Immigration"
AUS_czech_immigration_desc:0 "The Germans are pressing every able-bodied man into service somewhere in their emerging empire. However, Czech citizens clamour every day to escape this indentured servitude and find their place in the Austro-Hungarian empire. We, of course, welcome them."

AUS_demand_czech_autonomy:0 "Demand Czech Autonomy"
AUS_demand_czech_autonomy_desc:0 "Gaining direct control of Czechoslovakia might be a forlorn hope, but we can still petition for their autonomy under German rule. From there, our hope might not be so forlorn..."

AUS_allow_czech_volunteers:0 "Allow Czech Volunteers"
AUS_allow_czech_volunteers_desc:0 "The Czechoslovakian military is all but nonexistent, and the German occupation allows the people no way to fight for a country they see to be theirs. Czechoslovakian volunteers petition us every day to serve by the thousands - and it is time we let them."

AUS_operation_skoda:0 "Operation: Skoda"
AUS_operation_skoda_desc:0 "The Skoda engineering company is staffed with some of the brightest minds of the modernday - and based firmly in Nazi-controlled Czechoslovakia. Those minds would be best-placed serving our interests."

AUS_request_southern_slovakia:0 "Request Southern Slovakia"
AUS_request_southern_slovakia_desc:0 "Slovakia was always Austro-Hungarian land. It is only fair, now that our old ally controls it, that it be returned to us - and the case would be easy to make, if we cared to make it."

AUS_continue_secret_armament:0 "Continue Secret Armament"
AUS_continue_secret_armament_desc:0 "We have been supplying the resistance in Czechoslovakia with arms for an appreciable time now, at an appreciable cost. A case might be made to step that up into a full covert rearmament."

AUS_initiate_the_bohmen_plan:0 "Initiate the Böhmen Plan"
AUS_initiate_the_bohmen_plan_desc:0 "Czechoslovakia has been all but freed from German rule, and the time has come to directly challenge their control and restore our people to our union. War, if unpleasant, is at times necessary."
AUS_initiate_the_bohmen_plan_tt:0 "§YCzechoslovakia§! will become our puppet, but we will declare war on §RGermany.§!\n"

AUS_full_czech_citizenship:0 "Full Czech Citizenship"
AUS_full_czech_citizenship_desc:0 "Czechoslovakia was once Austro-Hungarian, and the people within it considered Austro-Hungarian. It is only fair and right that we restore this status so that our people may live free under our rule."

AUS_annex_bohemia_and_moravia_desc:0 "Bohemia and Moravia were once under our control and shall be again. We shall announce their annexation, and woe to any who challenge us."

AUS_seek_closer_ties_to_yugoslavia:0 "Seek Closer Ties to Yugoslavia"
AUS_seek_closer_ties_to_yugoslavia_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is not a dangerous foe, but their position makes them a potentially valuable ally. An invitation to the defensive pact we are forming will strengthen both of our positions."

AUS_demand_slovenia:0 "Demand Slovenia"
AUS_demand_slovenia_desc:0 "Yugoslavia has always been a weak country, and now it is under greater threat than ever before. It would be a simple thing to take from an already-intimidated people land that is rightfully ours."

AUS_invite_yugoslavia_to_faction:0 "Invite Yugoslavia to Faction"
AUS_invite_yugoslavia_to_faction_desc:0 "Our defensive pact with Yugoslavia has so far been mutually profitable, and the time has come to pursue a closer union - a more formal and concrete alliance."

AUS_war_for_the_balkans:0 "War for the Balkans"
AUS_war_for_the_balkans_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is in a weak position, and our territory in the Balkans is ripe for retaking. If we must go to war, then to war we will go to return Austro-Hungarian citizens to Austro-Hungarian civilization."

AUS_establish_research_partnership:0 "Establish Research Partnership"
AUS_establish_research_partnership_desc:0 "Another union of Austria-Hungary and Yugoslavia has been proposed; this time, between the greatest of our minds and the greatest of theirs. A research pact will benefit us both."

AUS_allow_croat_semi_autonomy:0 "Allow Croatian Semi-Autonomy"
AUS_allow_croat_semi_autonomy_desc:0 "The Croatians have always resented higher rule, ours no more or less than any others. Allowing them some autonomy will make things simpler for us in all respects."

AUS_supress_serbian_nationalists:0 "Suppress Serbian Nationalists"
AUS_supress_serbian_nationalists_desc:0 "The Serbians are a fiercely independent people, and their nationalist factions command much power in their own regions. It is time we put a stop to this - by force, if necessary."

AUS_establish_autonomous_serbian_puppet:0 "Establish Autonomous Serbian Puppet"
AUS_establish_autonomous_serbian_puppet_desc:0 "The Serbian nationalists have been a thorn in the side of Austro-Hungarian rule ever since Serbia fell once again under our jurisdiction. Allowing them autonomy under our rule is a simple and cost-minimal solution to the issue."

AUS_transylvania_or_war:0 "Transylvania or War"
AUS_transylvania_or_war_desc:0 "Romania swooped in like a vulture onto the region of Transylvania after the Great War. We must demand this land back, and the return of our people to our rule."

AUS_suppress_transylvanian_romanians_desc:0 "Despite the rightful Austro-Hungarian rule of Transylvania, there remains a nationalist Romanian element that remains an irritating thorn in the empire's side. Steps must be taken to suppress this."

AUS_deport_romanians:0 "Deport Transylvanian Romanians"
AUS_deport_romanians_desc:0 "The Romanian nationalists present in Transylvania present a constant and irritating challenge to our rule. Getting rid of them, however, will be less of a challenge, should we choose to."

AUS_form_holy_roman_empire:0 "Form the Holy Roman Empire"
AUS_form_holy_roman_empire_desc:0 "Austria-Hungary is not the oldest empire of central Europe. Once upon a time, the Holy Roman Empire was one of the strongest military and political powers of the day - and we control all the same land, the same people, the same military and political might. Do we dare reform the power that once ruled central Europe?"

AUS_reclaim_historical_lands:0 "Reclaim Historical Lands"
AUS_reclaim_historical_lands_desc:0 "With the declaration of the reformation of the Holy Roman Empire, we have tacitly laid claim to all territories the Empire once controlled. But we are the very same imperial power! We need not tacitly do anything. We shall announce our claim to the lands to the world."

 FIN_lean_jap:0 "Japanese Bonds"
 FIN_lean_jap_desc:0 "Over the years we have developed a surprisngly close relationship with Japan. There is a fascination with Finland in certain Japanese circles and visa-versa.

 FIN_est:0 "Estonian Cooperation"
 FIN_est_desc:0 "Although not a large or powerful nation, Estonia stands strong besides us, prepared to aid us in any way possible in case of we are attacked by the Soviet Union. For now this exists only as a secret alliance, but perhaps we could make some more overt connections?"

 FIN_jap_navy:0 "Japanese Naval Supremacy"

 FIN_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bomber Focus"
 FIN_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Finland only has so many resources to spend, so we are unlikely to rule the seas by might of ship alone. We should look into technologies that can take out our enemies' ships without the need of too many ships of our own."

 SWE_expand_lotta_desc:0 "The Women's Volunteer Defence Service (Lottorna) was created in 1924, inspired by a similar Finnish organization. Here women are able to help the war effort by doing many of the things that soldiers are too busy fighting to do, including making clothing and servicing the sick. Some even train with weapons in case of emergencies! This organization is worthy of our attention, and its expansion."
 SWE_fighting_women:0 "Mobilize the Lottorna"
 SWE_fighting_women_desc:0 "As war drags on we begin to require more men to fight. However, we are beginning to run short of even those barely considered men. Luckily, we have a group of people already used to war, with many of them already familiar with weaponry!

If we are to meet not only our own needs, but that of our customers, we need to expand our mining operations to their limit!"
 SWE_tungsten:0 "Expand Tungsten Production"
 SWE_tungsten_desc:0 "Sweden may not have the world's largest supply of Tungsten in the world, but we certainly do have more than most countries. If we are to capitalize on this rare metal, we need to expand our tungsten production to the highest levels possible!"
 SWE_expand_rail:0 "Expand the Rail Lines"
 SWE_expand_rail_desc:0 "Now that we have increased our mining production, we should also make sure that we can transport our goods to their destinations. More production is useless if we cannot move the extra supply!"
 SWE_defence:0 "Försvarsbeslut"
 SWE_defence_desc:0 "Every five years the military is reviewed before being given instructions on organization and focus in a "Defence Resolution" or "Försvarsbeslut". These resolutions can be used to plan the future of the Swedish military."
 SWE_army_ops:0 "Army Operations Staff"
 SWE_army_ops_desc:0 "Upon reviewing our armed forces, it has become abundently clear that our army is woefully disorganized by modern standards. If we wish to create an effective and modern military we must increase our communication and organization."
 SWE_tank_acquisition:0 "Tank Acquisition"
 SWE_tank_acquisition_desc:0 "Building a tank force is paramount for surviving in a modern war. At current we only possess a handful of old, outdated models. We cannot allow the current situation to remain as is."
 SWE_modern_cav:0 "A Modern Cavalry"
 SWE_modern_cav_desc:0 "Gone are the days of men on horseback riding in to save the day. Instead their will be men riding in metal beasts to the rescue. We need to make sure that this transition happens both quickly and smoothly."
 SWE_secret_ops:0 "Special Operations Staffs"
 SWE_secret_ops_desc:0 "If we are to have a modern army, then we must create departments solely dedicated to such things as Military Intelligence, Cryptography and Photography."
 SWE_air_defence:0 "Air Force Operations Staff"
 SWE_air_defence_desc:0 "The Air Force is too important to be a simple part of another military group. Instead the air force should be organized into its own distinct department, that can take care of all of its own unique needs."
 SWE_anti_air_focus:0 "Air Defence Staff"
 SWE_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "Air warfare has become a major part of war. Defending our territory from bombers and deterring scouts has become a top priority. We cannot entrust this task to an already existing department as they already have their own things to worry about. Instead we should create an anti-air defence department that deals entirely with our enemy's aircraft."
 SWE_navy_staff:0 "Navy Operations Staff"
 SWE_navy_staff_desc:0 "Our navy is one of our nation's greatest pride's and joy's. However its current organizational structure is old and outmoded. A simple restructuring should fix most of its current innefficencies."
 SWE_end_king:0 "Dismantle the Monarchy"
 SWE_end_king_desc:0 "That our country still has a monarchy is an insult to the people. Even more that the "King alone shall govern the realm" remains a part of our constitution. As a communist state, we cannot allow this to stand."
 SWE_north:0 "Rulers of the Norse"
 SWE_north_desc:0 "As the most successful descendents of the Norse, we are also the ones with the greatest claim to inherit their land. All of them."
 SWE_const_reform:0 "Constitutional Reform"
 SWE_const_reform_desc:0 "Although efficient for what we do now, the Swedish constitution is outmoded and needs to be updated for the times. Although we cannot do it immediately, we should start looking into the possibility of rewriting our constitution so that it matches with the times."
 SWE_history:0 "War History Staff"
 SWE_history_desc:0 "The study of history can teach us much, especially when it comes to the matter of warfare. If we can establish a department for the sole purpose of researching and applying military history, it would greatly increase our country's fighting potential."
 SWE_lessons:0 "Lessons of War"
 SWE_lessons_desc:0 "War has a long and complicated history, full of important characters from across the world. Alexander the Great, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Nelson, Napoleon, all these and more have played a great part in our understanding of war. In reading and studying of military practices, we can now work on applying them to our modern day situation. For despite all of our advances, despite all of our advanced technology, war never changes."
 SWE_motor:0 "Army Motorization"
 SWE_motor_desc:0 "The swedish army is disgracefully far behind on modern motorization and mechanization. We should invest in making it so that our troops can be properly supported."
 SWE_crypto:0 "Cryptographical Advances"
 SWE_crypto_desc:0 "As a focal point between the germans and the british, we are in a unique position to listen in to both sides. In doing so we can advance our own cryptographical abilities, both for encryption and decryption."
 SWE_artillery:0 "Support Weapons"
 SWE_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery, Anti-Tank, Anti-Air. All these are required in the modern army if one wishes to stand a ghost of a chance against an opponent. We cannot fall behind now."
 SWE_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms"
 SWE_combined_arms_desc:0 "A modern army is versatile, able to take on any threat. Should we get involved in any fighting, we need to be preapred to fight against any and all opponents, which means we need an army that has perfectly integrated every type of weaponry and tactics available."
 SWE_foreign_fighters:0 "Foreign Fighters"
 SWE_foreign_fighters_desc:0 "Sweden does not currently have the military capacity to produce its own fighters. Instead we need to turn to the world powers and see if any of them are willing to sell."
 SWE_domestic_fighters:0 "Domestic Fighters"
 SWE_domestic_fighters_desc:0 "Sweden can become reliant on foreign powers, we must develop our own fighters as soon as possible!"
 SWE_bomber_comp:0 "Bomber Competition"
 SWE_bomber_comp_desc:0 "Sweden cannot fall behind in its stock of bombers either. We should look into acquiring some."
 SWE_new_focus:0 "Secondary Air Focus"
 SWE_new_focus_desc:0 "Now that we have established production ideals for our fighters, it is time that we turned our attention to creating a second priority for our air forces. Should we focus on tactical bombing, strategic bombing, or some combination therein?"
 SWE_air_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Air"
 SWE_air_lessons_desc:0 "Having now seriously begun our acquisition of airplanes, we can finally begin to seriously look at effective strategems for using our newfound air force. This should prove most fruitful."
 SWE_amphibians:0 "Expand the Coastal Artillery Corps"
 SWE_amphibians_desc:0 "The Coastal Artillery Corps, or Kustartilleriet, is responsible for both protecting our shore from invasion, and for being the first boots on the ground in case we decide to send a naval invason. The KA are some of our toughest and most capable troops, it is time that we increased their size and funding."
 SWE_per_albin_line_1:0 "Coastal Per Albin Line"
 SWE_per_albin_line_1_desc:0 "Sweden cannot be allowed to be invaded by any of our enemies. In order to prevent this, we should create a lane of defence along the coast, preventing a naval assault."
 SWE_per_albin_line_2:0 "The Second Per Albin Line"
 SWE_per_albin_line_2_desc:0 "No plan is perfect, which is why one must always have a contingency plan in place. Should any attackers manage to get through our initial lines at the beaches, we must a have a secondary line ready to repel them from further advance into our country."
 SWE_def_focus:0 "Defensive Focus"
 SWE_def_focus_desc:0 "Sweden is not an aggressive nation, we do not launch attacks. We wait for the enemy to break themselves upon our lines instead."
 SWE_offensive_focus:0 "Offensive Focus"
 SWE_offensive_focus_desc:0 "No-one has ever successfully defended anything. If we wish to win a war, then we must rush the enemy with the force of a thousand storms, sweeping them before us."
 SWE_army_lessons:0 "Lessons From the Ground"
 SWE_army_lessons_desc:0 "Our study of army strategy has greatly increased our knowledge in that area. We are now prepared to adapt the newest and most worthy tactics and strategies!"
 SWE_interceptors:0 "Interceptor Technology"
 SWE_interceptors_desc:0 "Some of our scientists have come forward with a most interesting discovery, one that might forever change the nature of the sky. They claim to be able to make a plane travel several times faster than any current models. Their claims seem far-fetched, but our technicians tell us that their numbers seem correct. There can't be any harm in looking into this promising technology."
 SWE_convoy_protection:0 "Step-Up Convoy Protection"
 SWE_convoy_protection_desc:0 "Trade in the Baltic Sea is our lifeblood. Should the next war come, there will doubtless be attacks on our merchant vessels. As such we should expand as much effort as possible in building new ships that can protect our naval interests."
 SWE_dockyard:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
 SWE_dockyard_desc:0 "We cannot hope to create a powerful navy if we do not have the dockyards to build a navy at all. "
 SWE_dockyard2:0 "Shipbuilding Focus"
 SWE_dockyard2_desc:0 "Although we have expanded our dockyards to accomodate our need for a stronger navy, it is still not enough. If we wish to truly protect our shores then we must expand our fleet even more. And that requires more dockyards."
 SWE_screen:0 "Small Ship Building"
 SWE_screen_desc:0 "A navy does not consist of only large, powerful, ships. It also consists of small, powerful ships. We cannot forget this, and should invest in modern destroyers and light cruisers."
 SWE_heavy_ship:0 "Heavy Ship Building"
 SWE_heavy_ship_desc:0 "Large ships are things to be feared. Bristling with guns and ready to destroy all those who would dare oppose them. Our navy could use more of them."
 SWE_mil_fac:0 "Expand Military Industrial Capacity"
 SWE_mil_fac_desc:0 "Our guns need bullets to fire them, our planes need wings to fly, and our tanks need motors to drive. None of these things are created by magic, but by men in factories. We have men, we should give them factories."
 SWE_sub_focus:0 "Submersed Warfare"
 SWE_sub_focus_desc:0 "Not all of the fighting on the high seas has to take place above the sea. Below it lurks the submarines, waiting to destroy their much larger prey. Good subs can take out a ship several times their size and sneak away before anyone knows what hit them. We should invest in these deadly beasts of the deep."
 SWE_navy_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Sea"
 SWE_navy_lessons_desc:0 "As a scandinavian nation and as the descendants of the Norse, we have extensive knowledge and history of the sea. It is time that we finally compiled that knowledge and ensured it continuity. We can learn ten thousand lessons from the sea."
 SWE_navy_air:0 "Naval Air Power"
 SWE_navy_air_desc:0 "If we wish to truly control the seas, we cannot just focus on the seas themselves. We must also look to the skies. As large as ships may be, they are vulnerable to the payloads dropped by naval bombers."
 SWE_blitzkrieg:0 "Mobile Warfare"
 SWE_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "A modern army must strike quickly and without remorse. What better way than with tanks and other armored vehicles?"
 SWE_mass_assault:0 "Mass Assault"
 SWE_mass_assault_desc:0 "To win a war we must throw as more soldiers than the enemy can handle at any given location. We may not have the largest population, but by concentrating our infantry in strategic locations, we can break through their lines and force them to surrender!"
 SWE_superior_fire:0 "Superior Firepower"
 SWE_superior_fire_desc:0 "The guns of Sweden are strong, backed by a long history of quality weaponry. We may not be able to outnumber the enemy, but we will certainly be able to outgun them!"
 SWE_grand_battle:0 "Grand Battleplan"
 SWE_grand_battle_desc:0 "War will not come to Sweden swiflty, protected as we are from immediate attack. We should take advantage of this and make plans for every possible contigency. Should the enemy come knocking, we will have been expecting him."
 SWE_fake_oil:0 "Alternative Fuels"
 SWE_fake_oil_desc:0 "When war strikes we are cut off from much of that which we take for granted. Chief among these are oil and rubber. If we are going to be missing these materials, perhaps we can find alternatives, for at least a little while?"
 SWE_coastal_defence:0 "Coastal Defence"
 SWE_coastal_defence_desc:0 "The defence of our coastline is critical to our nation's survival, we should make sure that our operations on this matter are not only up to scratch, but better than everyone else."
 SWE_secrets:0 "Military Secrets"
 SWE_secrets_desc:0 "Our excellent spy networks, decryption, and world-class scientists have really pulled through for us over the years. Now they stand once again before us, telling us that they have gathered through various methods the secrets of powerful weaponry. Unfortunately, our country can only support one project of this scale. We must choose so that work can begin as soon as possible."

 NOR_kvinnehirden:0 "The Valkyries"
 NOR_kvinnehirden_desc:0 "The kvinnehirden, our female counterparts of the Hird, have long stood besides us in sanitation brigades.

 NOR_mobilize_3:0 "Special Forces Integration"
 NOR_mobilize_3_desc:0 "With our military becoming top-of-the-line, we need to start thinking about more advanced stratagems, some of which would likely include our special forces.

 NOR_full_train:0 "Revise Training Regime"
 NOR_full_train_desc:0 "For the last couple of decades we have reduced the amount of training recruits recieve to historically low amounts.

 NOR_central_af_desc:0 "As time marches on so too does the military. Until now our Air Forces have been split amongst the Army and the Navy, but recent events have proven that if we wish to most effectively utilize our air forces than they should be made into their own service, equivalent to that of the Army and Navy, not subservant."
 NOR_heavy_water:0 "Expand Vemork"

 NOR_split_fin:0 "Split Finland"

 CHL_claims_on_uruguay:0 "Securing the South Atlantic Ocean"
 CHL_claims_on_uruguay_desc:0 "With Argentina under us control of the South Atlantic also falls under our jurisdiction.

 CHL_infantry_focus:0 "Infantry Focus"
 CHL_infantry_focus_desc:0 "Tanks may be an interesting experiment but Chile does not have the industry to pursue such fanciful escapades. We should rely on tried and tested methods of warfare: infantry and artillery."

 CHL_naval_bomber_focus:0 "New Torpedo Bomber Designs"
 CHL_naval_bomber_focus_desc:0 "It is all well and good having modern carriers but they are useless without modern aircraft. We must update our torpedo bomber designs to ensure that they can strike out effectively and to devastating effect."
 CHL_expand_talcahuano:0 "Expand the Talcahuano Shipyard"
 CHL_expand_talcahuano_desc:0 "Our largest shipyard is at Talcahuano but it is insufficient for our needs. We must expand our naval capacity to allow for larger designs of ship to be built."

 CHL_mechanized:0 "Mechanized Effort"

 CHL_artillery:0 "Artillery Effort"

 CHL_support:0 "Support Effort"
 CHL_support_desc:0 "Infantry alone is ineffective. Not only does infantry require ordinance support but logistical, reconnaissance and specialist support. We should not allow these elements of our army to lag behind."
 CHL_rockets:0 "Rocketry"
 CHL_rockets_desc:0 "Our researchers have come to us with an interesting proposition: rockets. They say that the future of artillery lies in their exploitation. Certainly, we are not the type to turn down an opportunity for an even more effective way of bombarding our foes. We should investigate these rockets and see if they are worthwhile."

 CHL_marines_focus:0 "Chilean Marines"

 CHL_nationalise_all:0 "Nationalise All Industry"
 CHL_nationalise_all_desc:0 "For too long have the bourgeois grown fat off the labour of the common man. No longer shall we tolerate indolent overseers and tyrannical taskmasters.

 CHL_communist_faction:0 "Found the Communist Latin Union"
 CHL_communist_faction_desc:0 "The Comintern makes a mockery of true communism - they are not even socialists. Stalin is no more than a despotic tsar ruling through fear. We should found our own faction of truly communist states and propagate our own revolution."

 CHL_preemptive_measures_desc:0 "We must prepare ourselves for the unfortunate inevitability of war. Peru is the most immediate threat but we should ready ourselves for any eventuality."
 CHL_join_allies:0 "Join the Allies"
 CHL_join_allies_desc:0 "Alone Chile is vulnerable to external powers greater than herself. We must find Allies to help defend ourselves against those who would seek to tear down our democracy and we must reciprocate in ensuring that liberty everywhere is protected."
 CHL_trade_deals:0 "Trade Deals"
 CHL_trade_deals_desc:0 "Chile is too closely linked with Germany and the other fascist ilk for prosperity. We should pursue new trade opportunities with the other democracies of the world."
 CHL_expand_private_sector:0 "Expand the Private Sector"
 CHL_expand_private_sector_desc:0 "Far too much of the Chilean economy is publicly owned. We should reduce the government's involvement to increase competition and efficiency. Both the people and the economy shall benefit from this."

 CHL_crackdown:0 "Crackdown on the Dissidents"
 CHL_crackdown_desc:0 "The radical left and radical right have ran rampant in this country for too long. No more can the government simply be reactionary to their attempted coups and violent outbursts. We must seek out and remove the political threat they pose to our nation."
 CHL_ties_with_argentina:0 "Pursue Ties with Argentina"

 CHL_patriotic_leagues:0 "Re-establish the Patriotic Leagues"
 CHL_patriotic_leagues_desc:0 "The Patriotic Leagues were a paramilitary organisation which ensured the nationalist spirit of Chile was never quashed, however, they dissolved some ten years since. We should re-establish this honourable organisation and encourage it."
 CHL_ban_communism:0 "Ban Communism"

 CHL_expand_alliance:0 "Expand the Alliance"
 CHL_expand_alliance_desc:0 "We should expand our alliance to our neighbours to strengthen ourselves and also to protect them from any warmongering neighbours. Uruguay is of strategic importance in the Atlantic region but cannot defend itself. We should offer for them to join us."
 CHL_paraguayan_threat:0 "The Paraguayan Threat"
 CHL_paraguayan_threat_desc:0 "Paraguay cannot be allowed to remain on our border. They propose a communist regime which threatens the delicate balance of South America. If we do not act soon then they may send agents against us first."
 CHL_establish_the_airforce:0 "Invest in Linea Aerea Nacional"
 CHL_establish_the_airforce_desc:0 "Linea Aerea Nacional was established in 1932 under Carlos Ibáñez del Campo but, as yet, it is only a small fleet. The skies will prove a necessary battlefield and, as such, aircraft a necessary investment. Our military industrial complex cannot facilitate an enormous air force so we should focus on making the best use of what we have."
 CHL_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
 CHL_bomber_focus_desc:0 "We should focus or aviation efforts on bombers as they are versatile and have a strong payload."

No more, from now on Liberia goes alone, regardless of the consequences!"

 LIB_new_leader:0 "A Leader for the Cause"
 LIB_new_leader_desc:0 "Although we have begun to create an organization that opposes the current government, we lack the unifying component of a leader. Unless we wish to be torn apart by internal strife, we must choose a leader for our people."

 LIB_rightful_rulers:0 "RIghtful Rulers of Africa"
 LIB_rightful_rulers_desc:0 "It is no secret that Germany has a problem in Africa, not least that their... less than tolerant policies have turned possible supporters into ardent enemies. Using the unique history of Liberia, perhaps we can convince them that we are the rightful rulers of Africa, who deserve to be respected as Japan, Italy, or Tibet."

 LIB_foreign_training:0 "Foreign Officer Training"

 LIB_create_navy:0 "Birth of the Navy"
 LIB_create_navy_desc:0 "Liberia has historically always relied on the United States to protect it on the high seas.

On this day, the LIB.GetAdjective Navy has been brought forth into this world, to be baptized by fire and water!"
 LIB_form_airforce:0 "Create the Liberian Air Corps"
 LIB_form_airforce_desc:0 "Our nation has lagged far behind in the skies. The number of planes in our ocuntry can be counted on hands, and none of them serve a military purpose! We will change this with the creation of a new air force, ready to take on any who dare oppose us!"
 LIB_ind_airports:0 "A Place to Land"
 LIB_ind_airports_desc:0 "Now that we have established an independent Air Force, we need to actually put in the infrastructure necessary for it to function. Preferably starting with an airport and a way to get to that airport."
 LIB_ind_port:0 "A True Port"
 LIB_ind_port_desc:0 "The port in Monrovia barely begs the name. So rocky and treacherous most boats refuse to land, anchoring offshore and taking smaller boats to the shore. It is high-time that we built a real port in Liberia."
 LIB_ind_nav_doc:0 "Develop Naval Doctrine"
 LIB_ind_nav_doc_desc:0 "Now that we have the capacity for a navy, we need to consider what the navy will actually do beyond the very basics. Shoot the other guy does not a strategy make."
 LIB_marines_focus:0 "River, Jungle and Ocean"
 LIB_marines_focus_desc:0 "Liberia does not have the most immediately hospitable climate in the world. Our soldiers must learn to survive high heat, jungles, and rivers. We should encourage the best of those soldiers and create a special task force for them to train and serve in."

 LIB_ind_war_studies_desc:0 "If our new military is to be successful, ou officers must become versed in the ways of war. We shall ensure that our officers study all of the classics as well as the lessons learned from the more recent wars."
 LIB_reinvite_firestone:0 "Reparations for Firestone"

 LIB_national_rubber_desc:0 "Without Firestone's expertise, we have found mantaining our rubber plantations to be difficult.

 LIB_army_inno_desc:0 "Our new revitalized military has sparked competition among our new local arms manufacturers. This has led to some innovation in weapon design."

 LIB_develop_land_doctrine:0 "Expand Army Doctrine"
 LIB_develop_land_doctrine_desc:0 "Our military works off of old ideas and thought. We may be more disciplined, but we find ourselves fully unprepared to deal with the realities of modern war. New military thought must be developed among our soldiers, or else we may never be able to fight toe-to-toe with another country."
 LIB_combined_tech:0 "Combined Technologies"
 LIB_combined_tech_desc:0 "The different parts of our military have been working fairly independently from one another. This has led to duplicate designs and wasted time. By encouraging inter-service cooperation and innovation, we should be able to greatly increase our military's innovation capability."

 LIB_trade_concessions:0 "Trade Concessions"

 LIB_us_mil_coop:0 "US Military Cooperation"
 LIB_us_mil_coop_desc:0 "Our Frontier Force has become a caricature of corruption and incompetence. No-one trusts them and we cannot rely on them for protection. The US has offered us some of their officers from their Colored Troop regiments in order to train our soldiers and teach our officers. "

 LIB_end_negotiations_desc:0 "Our country has been under investigation by the League of Nations since 1929, with formal recommendations coming out in 1931.

 LIB_establish_iron_comp:0 "Liberian Mining Company"
 LIB_establish_iron_comp_desc:0 "The Bomi Hills have proven to be even more full of iron and diamonds than we had first expected.

 LIB_american_steel:0 "American Iron Interests"
 LIB_american_steel_desc:0 "Companies from the US usch as Republic Steel and US Steel have expressed an interest in our Bomi Hill region. We will need to decide if we wish to allow them to invest in the region or not."
 LIB_dutch_investment:0 "Dutch Investment"
 LIB_dutch_investment_desc:0 "Continued interest in our countr from the Dutch has proven useful as their companies provide a diverse source of investment into our country. Their profitability helps as well."
 LIB_officer_schools:0 "Establish Officer Schools"
 LIB_officer_schools_desc:0 "Our military's officers struggle with a lack of formal training or education. Our US advisors and military staff have noticed this and begun to establish formal schools for the training and education of our army's officers."
 LIB_anti_fascism:0 "Anti-Fascism"
 LIB_anti_fascism_desc:0 "Fascism stands as an anathema to eveything that a liberal democracy should stand for. We cannot stand by as the world turns towards fire."
 LIB_air_nav:0 "Air Navigation Agreement"
 LIB_air_nav_desc:0 "As we close our relationship with the United States, our interests have become more and more intertwined. Our country's lack of airfields or bases has caught the attention of the US, who recognize our strategic importance. They have offered to build air bases and airfields in our country in exchange for their free use of said airfields. We have no reason to not accept these free buildings."
 LIB_us_training:0 "American Training Methods"
 LIB_us_training_desc:0 "As we continue to retrain our military, we have found that our old training methods were not only inadequate, but next to useless. Luckily we have American officers to show us how to properly train a soldier."
 LIB_military_infra:0 "Military Infrastructure"
 LIB_military_infra_desc:0 "As our country modernizes its military, we cannot forgot the other parts of our country. Transportation outside of Monrovia is notoriously terrible, and it is time that we invested into our roads and highways so that in the case of an emergency our troops can actually reach their destinations in a timely manner."
 LIB_fix_militia:0 "Update the Militia"
 LIB_fix_militia_desc:0 "Based upon the original American militias such as the "Minutemen", Liberian militias stand ready to fight should our country ever come under attack. At least they should. In practice however they are poorly trained, have to buy their own equipment, and have low motivation. If we wish to actually rely on our militia, we must ready them just as we ready our regular forces."
 LIB_focus_mil:0 "Focus on the Frontier Force"
 LIB_focus_mil_desc:0 "Although we would like to update our militia, we must focus on one thing at a time, and right now that is ensuring that our regulars are ready to fight, never mind our militia."
 LIB_air_tech:0 "Air Technologies"
 LIB_air_tech_desc:0 "Liberia has very few planes, all of which are owned by private companies. Now that the US has begun to build airfields in our country and showed us the importance of air power, we should begin to invest our own country's air power."
 LIB_establish_air_doc:0 "Establish Air Doctrine"
 LIB_establish_air_doc_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to build airplanes, we must determine how to use them."
 LIB_areas_defense:0 "Areas Defense Agreement"
 LIB_areas_defense_desc:0 "As the war progresses, we only grow closer to the United States, both financially and militarily. They have offered to build infrastructure, military bases, and more so long as we allow them to use those things over the course of the war. We cannot turn down such expensive projects when offered at no cost! Especially not to such a close ally."
 LIB_expand_gold:0 "Expand the Gold and Diamond Mines"
 LIB_expand_gold_desc:0 "All that glitters is not gold sometimes it's diamonds. We have been mining both since the 1800's, but we have lacked the technology and financial means to truly tap into these resources. It's time that we finally began to make a move."
 LIB_interior_infra:0 "Interior Infrastructure"
 LIB_interior_infra_desc:0 "The majority of our roads and development occur near the coastline of our country. Now, with the help of the US, we can finally begin to make in-roads into the interior of our country."
 LIB_us_mil_facs:0 "New Arms Factories"
 LIB_us_mil_facs_desc:0 "The US cannot simply just import every single weapon that it needs. They need some local way of creating their war materials. Luckily for them, we are quite willing to give them the land they need to construct their factories."
 LIB_mil_sup:0 "US Military Lend-Lease"
 LIB_mil_sup_desc:0 "The US military has offered us their weapons and military hardware at a very affordable cost. They have even set aside some production for us so that we can equip our troops."
 LIB_interior_airfields:0 "Interior Airfields"
 LIB_interior_airfields_desc:0 "With the US moving many of their operations to our interior, that means that they also need to move their planes in their as well."

 LIB_dutch_roads:0 "Dutch Roads"

 LIB_port:0 "Port Agreement"
 LIB_port_desc:0 "Liberia has long suffered from not having a proper port. Many companies have expressed interest in our country only to turn away from our rocky and treacherous shores that lack any way for their ships to safely dock. The US has gracefully offered to build us a large and modern port. The proceeds of the port will go to the US until the building cost has been repaid, but this is a tiny price to pay for such an extravagant building project!"
 LIB_navy:0 "Liberian Naval Thought"
 LIB_navy_desc:0 "Outside of a few dinghy's not even big enough to deserve the term "boat" Liberia has lacked any sort of naval presence, relying entirely on the US for protection from the seas. Now that we have begun to modernize and the US has begun to build us a real port, we can finally begin to think about how to defend the coastline ourselves."
 LIB_nav_tech:0 "Naval Technologies"
 LIB_nav_tech_desc:0 "We are hopelessly behind in naval technologies, we can only try as hard as we can to catch up."
 LIB_end_neutrality:0 "Join the Fight"

 LIB_us_tech:0 "US Technological Agreements"

 LIB_allied_advances:0 "Allied Advances"
 LIB_allied_advances_desc:0 "Now that we have joined the war proper, we have access to the various technologies at the disposal of our allies. This should benefit us greatly."
 LIB_foreign_tech2:0 "Foreign Technologies"

 LIB_mining_advances:0 "Mining and Construction Advances"
 LIB_mining_advances_desc:0 "Our country has come an amazingly far way in just a few short years. Already we have made huge strides in our mining and construction techniques. This has opened up many doors to us that we had never even known existed."
 LIB_pay_on_time:0 "On-Time Pay"
 LIB_pay_on_time_desc:0 "For too long our soldiers have had to put up with mountains of arrears, being paid weeks or months after they were supposed to have been. Our adminstrative reforms have allowed for a greater efficiency that removes any reason for a continuation of this situation."
 LIB_mil_doc:0 "Liberian Military Doctrine"
 LIB_mil_doc_desc:0 "We have been relying entirely on the US to provide us with militay doctrine. Now that we have begun to establish our own military prowess, we should look into promoting our own officers' plans."

 LIB_us_iron:0 "US Iron Interests"

 LIB_us_firestone:0 "Firestone Sponsored"

 LIB_modern_guns:0 "Import Modern Guns"
 LIB_modern_guns_desc:0 "Our guns certainly work, but when compared to the rest of the world, we are very far behind. We need to upgrade our arsenal so that our soldiers can match the rate of fire and accuracy of the enemy. Otherwise we shall be torn apart even if we do manage to reform our military!"
 LIB_modern_arty:0 "Modern Artillery"
 LIB_modern_arty_desc:0 "What little artillery we have is hopelessly outdated. We need to upgrade just as we did with our guns."
 LIB_auto_tech:0 "Import Automobiles"
 LIB_auto_tech_desc:0 "Cars, trucks and other automobiles are relatively new to Liberia. We have fallen behind their use not only in the transportation industry, but in the war-fighting industry as well! We need to import foreign vehicles so that we can begin producing our own."
 LIB_armor_tech:0 "Great Tractors"
 LIB_armor_tech_desc:0 "We were not impressed when we first heard of the Great Tractors in Europe, until we realized that they were death on treads. Now we realize that we must study them, so that we can fight them, and perhaps someday make some of our own!"
 LIB_special_forces:0 "Elite Forces"
 LIB_special_forces_desc:0 "Up until now, our idea of elite troops were the non-corrupt Frontier Force soldiers. Now that we have paid and disciplined soldiers, we can begin the process of establishing specialized forces made up of the best of the best."
 LIB_jungle_training:0 "The Advantages of Africa"
 LIB_jungle_training_desc:0 "Although our location in Africa has caused our country many problems, from an isolated position to difficulty building settlements. However, our military training has caused us to realize that there are advantages to our location. Our troops are prepared for environments that most troops from Europe or America are unprepared for. We should capitalize on this advantage, for it is one of the few we have."
 LIB_greenback:0 "Complete Switch to Greenback"
 LIB_greenback_desc:0 "Starting last year our country has begun the process of switching out the pound for the US dollar. We do still produce some of our own currency, but this way we have an internationally accepted currency that does not hail from an imperialist power who wished our country gone."

 ETH_gas_reform_desc:0 "For all of our attempts at modernization, we were not ready for a modern war. The enemy has unleashed upon us the most heinous of devices of modern warfare, mustard gas! As they rule the skies the Italians continually bomb our soldiers as they run for cover and gas us whenever they fear our victory. There are techniques for lessening the impact of these attacks, we just have to make sure that our whole army learns these lessons. Preferably before we are overrun."
 ETH_triumph_in_africa:0 "Triumph in Africa"

 ETH_restoration:0 "Solomonic Restoration"
 ETH_restoration_desc:0 "For too long the Emperor has been bogged down by the power of regional nobles, forced to make concessions not for the good of the country but for the good of the nobles. We have been working to centralize power and reform the Solomonic Succession which has caused so many problems. The time has finally come. We will put all our faith in the Emperor and his children. Ethiopia will be reborn!"
 ETH_extend_line:0 "Extend the Dagghabur Line"
 ETH_extend_line_desc:0 "Our southern line risks being overrun should our advance there ever be halted. Although we have constructed defences to the south of Dagghabur, our own "Maginot Line", there is nothing stopping our enemies from simply going around it. If we wish to truly hold the enemy back, we will need to expand this defensive line until it covers all possible points of entry into our country."
 ETH_new_techniques:0 "Modern Strategems"
 ETH_new_techniques_desc:0 "The old ways have had their time. We can no longer rely on simply rushing the enemy with our men in order to win. As our weapons become more sophisticated we must take care to ensure that our tactics do not fall behind, regardless of the honour of those tactics."
 ETH_break_arms_embargo:0 "Negotiate the Arms Embargo"
 ETH_break_arms_embargo_desc:0 "When the Italians began their invasion, the British and French declared a full arms embargo, knowing full well that this would only help the Italians. They even went so far as to seize weapons that had been donated to our cause. Now we are even more poorly equipped than ever before, and if we wish to fight back, we will need to try and break this embargo by all means necessary."
 ETH_jap_support:0 "Japanese Support"
 ETH_jap_support_desc:0 "So far Japan has refused to help us even diplomatically despite our appeals to them. Their populace supports us, seeing a kinship with us in our resistance to European intrusion. Now we just need to translate that into official support."
 ETH_ger_support:0 "German Support"
 ETH_ger_support_desc:0 "Of all the countries in Europe, it was the Germans who sent us supplies. Not the democracies, not the protectors of liberalism, not the revolutionaries, but the Nazis. We owe them much, and had it not been for French interference we would have a small mountain of German rifles. We should see if this support still rings true."
 ETH_fra_support:0 "French Support"
 ETH_fra_support_desc:0 "The French speak a good game, but when push came to shove they did nothing to stop the Italian invasion. They even seized shipments of weapons destined for our country due to the arms embargo, depriving us of much needed supplies. Perhaps this could be re-negotiated?"
 ETH_eng_support:0 "British Support"
 ETH_eng_support_desc:0 "The British public supports us by a large margin, but the political class does not. With labour having lost the last election, we need someway to convince the government to support us like their public does."
 ETH_trust_in_lon:0 "Trust in International Action"
 ETH_trust_in_lon_desc:0 "We were failed by the League of Nations and the international political community, but that does not mean that we need to give up on the system. Many across the world showed support for our cause and we will never forget that. We must work to improve the problems with the League of Nations, not just torch the entire project."
 ETH_ignore_lon:0 "Nationalism"
 ETH_ignore_lon_desc:0 "We have been tricked for the last time by the Western Powers. They have failed us just as they will fail others. We cannot ever count on the international community to act strongly in order to stop a crisis. We can only count on ourselves."
 ETH_re_establish_japanese_ties:0 "Re-Establish Japanese Ties"
 ETH_re_establish_japanese_ties_desc:0 "The Japanese government betrayed us to the Italians in 1935, but this decision was met with quite a bit of anger on the ground. Now that we have won the war, perhaps they would be interested in re-establishing ties."
 ETH_close_to_ger:0 "Draw Closer to Germany"
 ETH_close_to_ger_desc:0 "Germany has shown that they will go the the extra mile for any country that they support. This is more than we can say for the so-called keepers of peace in France or the United Kingdom. We know who our supporters are, we go with the Germans!"
 ETH_close_fra:0 "Improve French Relations"
 ETH_close_fra_desc:0 "France may not have backed us in our way, but this was done out of fear of Germany. Now that the war is over, they will certainly re-establish connections with us."
 ETH_befriend_eng:0 "Befriend the Empire"
 ETH_befriend_eng_desc:0 "We may not trust Britain, and quite frankly we probably shouldn't. Although many of their citizens supported our cause, the government could not imagine backing us Africans over our European attackers. Still, they border our country and pose an immediate threat. We must make nice or die."
 ETH_follow_jap:0 "Follow the Japanese Example"
 ETH_follow_jap_desc:0 "The events of the war have only proven the thoughts of Herouy Wolde Selassie and the other 'Young Japanisers' correct. The West fears a Japan of Africa, as they should. We rise with the sun, in the model of Japan."
 ETH_leave_lon:0 "Leave the League of Nations"
 ETH_leave_lon_desc:0 "Enough of the hypocrisy, enough of the inaction. The League works only for the powerful countries and does nothing for those who need it. It has become clear that the model of internationalism is fundamentally broken. We must speak for ourselves, because no-one else will."
 ETH_re_invite_foreign_missions:0 "Re-Invite Foreign Missions"
 ETH_re_invite_foreign_missions_desc:0 "The war caused all but our most loyal foreign agents to flee. Without them, our military will have a hard time modernizing. If we wish to drag ourselves into the modern era, we will need some foreign support and training."

 ETH_fra_roads:0 "Expand the Djibouti Rail Lines"
 ETH_fra_roads_desc:0 "Our rail lines are rather... lacking. Our mountainuos country makes building tracks or roads difficult.

 ETH_improve_encryption:0 "Improve Encryption"
 ETH_improve_encryption_desc:0 "Our country has relied mainly on runners do to our lack of radio for many years, and although we have now begun acquiring radios we do still have a problem.

 ETH_more_congress:0 "Increase the Power of the Legislature"
 ETH_more_congress_desc:0 "The current constitution has the Parliament acting largely as an advisory body with little true power, with its main advantage being the ability to keep the nobles tied up in the capital as senators rather than causing trouble at home. We should push for an increase in Legislative power in order to try and force at least some control over the Emperor's whims. "
 ETH_solidify_imperial_power:0 "Solidify Imperial Power"

 ETH_go_communist:0 "The Voice of the People"
 ETH_go_communist_desc:0 "For far too long the people of Ethiopia have been oppressed. Even as power has supposedly been granted to them, it only hides the fact that the true masters remain the same.

 ETH_com_militias:0 "From Levies to Militias"
 ETH_com_militias_desc:0 "Every man is expected to be ready to fight for the Empire in case of attack.

The best part is that it will appear to be a boon for the Empire, when in fact these militias will be its death!"

 ETH_turn_evil:0 "Look Into The Darkness"

 ETH_as_in_the_east:0 "The Eastern Dawn"
 ETH_as_in_the_east_desc:0 "The Japanese are the rightful rulers of the Far East, their actions and power speak to theat. The Germans have proven themselves the masters of Europe. But what of Africa? We are the unconquered people, the ones whom no European can match. When the New World Order comes, we will rule the continent in friendship with the Japanese and Germans. Together we will create the perfect triarchy!"

 ETH_restrict_nobles:0 "Restrict Noble Priveleges"
 ETH_restrict_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have had a stranglehold on the country for years and only in the last couple of decades have we been able to loosen their grasp.

 ETH_abolish_slavery:0 "Abolish the Gedar System"
 ETH_abolish_slavery_desc:0 "The Gedar system is a horribly outdated idea that significantly weakens our outside influence and restricts our ability to modernize. Sure the nobles like this feudalistic system that encourages what essentally amounts to slavery, but the Italians got a lot of positive press for claiming to be coming in to abolish this system. We cannot allow another country to define the narrative in such a way ever again!"

 ETH_buy_planes:0 "Plane Purchases"
 ETH_buy_planes_desc:0 "We can only build planes so quickly when we have so little industry. We must look to see if any countries are willing to sell us their overstock. Even out-of-date models will allow us to build up a fleet and give our would-be pilots experience in the air."

 ETH_integrate_eritrea_desc:0 "We have finally reclaimed the lost province of Eritrea! We need to re-integrate these people back into our empire as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there are those who would stand in our way, the so-called Eritrean nationalists who foolishly believe that Eritrea's destiny differs from the Empires. Perhaps we could assuage some of their members by grantingt the province greater autonomy, for now."
 ETH_crush_eritrea:0 "Crush Eritrean Nationalism"

 ETH_establish_somalian_puppet_desc:0 "The various Somali peoples in our lands have long not exactly been the most stable subjects. However, this largely stems from the lack of a coutnry they can truly call their own that isn't ours. With our control of Somalia, we can change that. We will create a highly autonomous puppet state under the governership of a loyal Somali. This will hopefully quell much of the Somali unrest in our country."
 ETH_order_in_somalia:0 "Force Somalian Integration"
 ETH_order_in_somalia_desc:0 "The Somalians in our country have long resisted and resented our rule. They simply refuse to follow the rules of the empire. For too long we have been unable to punish this behavior, but times have changed. They will obey our rule, or else."

 ETH_modern_weapons:0 "Weapons for the Modern Age"
 ETH_modern_weapons_desc:0 "The importance of modern weaponry may be somewhat overstated at times, we ourselves have proven this multiple time. But we still cannot pretend that they are very helpful. Our country relies far too heavily on pre-established weaponry, much of it pre-1900. The time has definitely come for an upgrade. Several upgrades actually."
 ETH_trucks:0 "Capacity for Mechanized Units"
 ETH_trucks_desc:0 "Our country has only recently been getting involved with automobiles. Our country is largely not conducive to them, but with changing technologies this has become less and less of an excuse.

 ETH_motor_infr:0 "Road Construction"

 ETH_tank_focus:0 "Our Own Armor"
 ETH_tank_focus_desc:0 "The Italians used armour against us in the war, and we proved that it was not as great as advertised, at least in the north. The south however tells us a different story, armour in a flat setting can be absolutely devastating, and we need to create some of our own as soon as possible!"
 ETH_arty_focus:0 "Modern Artillery"

 ETH_eritrean_industry:0 "Build Up Eritrean Industry"
 ETH_eritrean_industry_desc:0 "For all their claims of uplifting the Africans, the Europeans have really done a shoddy job of actually bringing real industry to the continent. It now lies to us to show the Eritreans proper industry."
