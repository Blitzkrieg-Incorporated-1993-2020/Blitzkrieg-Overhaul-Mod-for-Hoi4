Some of you, perhaps, have already heard what it contains but I would just like to read it to you: "We, the German Führer and Chancelor, and the British Prime Minister, have had a further meeting today and are agreed in recognizing that the question of anglo-german relations is of the first importance for the two countries and for Europe. We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again."\nNeville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 30/09/1938, Heastone Aerodrome, London"

I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more, or anything different, that I could have done, and that would have been more successful. Up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland. But Hitler would not have it; he had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened. And although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement. The proposals were never shown to the Poles, nor to us. And though they were announced in the German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning. His action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today in fulfillment of our obligations going to the aid of Poland who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience, we have done all that any country could do to establish peace, but a situation in which no word given by Germany's ruler could be trusted, and no people or country could feel itself safe, had become intolerable.

At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."\nSir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 04/06/1940, House of Commons, London, United Kingdom"

The French Government will be throwing away great opportunities and casting away their future if they do not continue the war in accordance with their Treaty obligations, from which we have not felt able to release them. The House will have read the historic declaration in which, at the desire of many Frenchmen, and of our own hearts, we have proclaimed our willingness to conclude at the darkest hour in French history a union of common citizenship. However matters may go in France or with the French Government or with another French Government, we in this island and in the British Empire will never lose our sense of comradeship with the French people. If we are now called upon to endure what they have suffered we shall emulate their courage, and if final victory rewards our toils they shall share the gains, aye. And freedom shall be restored to all. We abate nothing of our just demands—Czechs, Poles, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians, all who have joined their causes to our own shall be restored. What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own British life and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him all Europe may be free, and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands; but if we fail then the whole world, including the United States, and all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more prolonged, by the lights of a perverted science.

Here we are together, facing a group of mighty foes who seek our ruin. Here we are together, defending all that to free men is dear. Twice in a single generation the catastrophe of world war has fallen upon us. Twice in our lifetime has the long arm of fate reached out across the oceans to bring the United States into the forefront of the battle.

Let me proclaim my faith, which is the faith of millions of all races from end to end of the British Empire. Here we have ceased to be an island, but we are still an Empire. And what is her secret? Freedom, ordered freedom, within the law, with force in the background and not in the foreground: a society in which authority and freedom are blended in due proportion, in which state and citizen are both ends and means. It is an empire organised for peace and for the free development of the individual in and through an infinite variety of voluntary associations. It neither deifies the state nor its rulers. The fruits of a free spirit of men do not grow in the garden of tyranny. It’s been well said that slavery is a weed that grows in every soil.

The result of these conditions would be the complete demobilisation of the French land, sea, and air forces, the surrender of our weapons and the total occupation of French territory. The French government would come under German and Italian tutelage. It may therefore be said that this armistice would not only be a capitulation, but that it would also reduce the country to slavery. Now, a great many Frenchmen refuse to accept either capitulation or slavery, for reasons which are called: honour, common sense, and the higher interests of the country. It is therefore necessary to group the largest possible French force wherever this can be done. Everything which can be collected by way of French military elements and potentialities for armaments production must be organised wherever such elements exist. I, General de Gaulle, am undertaking this national task here in England. I call upon all French servicemen of the land, sea, and air forces; I call upon French engineers and skilled armaments workers who are on British soil, or have the means of getting here, to come and join me. I call upon the leaders, together with all soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the French land, sea, and air forces, wherever they may now be, to get in touch with me.

sp_ger_hitler_response_to_roosevelt_desc:0 ""The American President further declares that he would then communicate information received by him concerning the political aims of Germany to other nations now apprehensive Its to the course of our policy. How has Mr. Roosevelt learned which nations consider themselves threatened by German policy and which do not? Or is Mr. Roosevelt in a position, with the enormous amount of work which he must have to do in his own country, to recognize of his own accord all the inmost thoughts and feelings of other peoples and their governments? Finally, Mr. Roosevelt asks that assurances be given him that the German armed forces will not attack, and above all, not invade, the territory or possessions of the following independent nations. He then names as those to which he refers: Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iraq, the Arabias, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Iran. Answers I have first taken the trouble to ascertain from the states mentioned, firstly, whether they feel themselves threatened, and, what is most important, secondly, whether this inquiry by the American President was addressed to us at their suggestion or at least with their consent. The reply was in all cases negative, in some instances strongly so. It is true that there were certain ones among the states and nations mentioned, whom I could not question because they themselves – as for example, Syria – are at present not in possession of their freedom, but are under occupation by the military agents of democratic states and consequently deprived of their rights. Apart from this fact, however, all states bordering on Germany have received much more binding assurances and -particularly, more binding proposals than Mr. Roosevelt asked from me in his curious telegram."\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 24/08/1939, Reichstag, Berlin, Germany"

In its depravity and degeneracy it has now become insufferable. Danzig was a German city and is a German city! The Corridor was German and is German! These regions owe their cultural development exclusively to the German Volk. Without this Volk, these eastern regions would still be plunged in the depths of barbarism. Danzig was torn from us! Poland annexed the Corridor! The German minorities living there are being persecuted in the vilest manner imaginable. In the years 1919 and 1920 over one million men of German blood were forced to leave their homeland. |...| As a National Socialist and a German soldier I enter into this struggle with a strong heart! My life was but one struggle for the German Volk, for its resurrection, for Germany. This struggle was governed by only one creed: faith in this Volk! There is one word which I have never known and this word is: capitulation! |...| I would like to assure the world around us of one thing: there shall never ever be another November 1918 in German history! Since I myself stand ever ready to lay down my life for my Volk and Germany, I demand the same of everyone else! Whoever believes he can oppose this national commandment shall fall! We will have nothing to do with traitors! And all of us pledge ourselves to the one ancient principle: it is of no importance if we ourselves live-as long as our Volk lives, as long as Germany lives! This is essential. We expect of all of you as the Reich’s emissaries henceforth that you shall do your duty wherever you may be assigned! You must carry the banner of resistance forth regardless of the cost. |...| Provided all of us form part of this community, sworn together, determined never to capitulate, then our will shall master all need.

Today, I can state: everything since has gone according to plan. |...| I can say this here today. I say this here today because I may say today that this opponent has already broken down and will never rise again! There was a power massed against Europe, of which most people regrettably had no idea and of which many today still have no idea. This could have become a second Mongolian invasion by a new Genghis Khan. That this danger was averted, we owe primarily to the bravery and perseverance of our German soldiers, to their willingness to sacrifice. Then, we owe it to the sacrifices of all those who marched with us."\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 03/10/1941, Sportpalast, Berlin, Germany"

sp_ger_the_destruction_of_bolshevism_desc:0 ""I believe that, in looking back, we can be content with the past three years. The objective was always very sober; bold where it had to be bold, prudent where it could be prudent; unhurried where we had time, cautious where we believed that we had to be cautious under all circumstances. However, we were being daring where daring alone could help. For this year, we have drawn up a very simple program. First: under all circumstances, to hold what must be held. |...| Second: it’s absolutely imperative to attack where an attack is necessary under all circumstances. The objective is clear: the destruction of the right arm of this international conspiracy of capitalism, plutocracy, and Bolshevism, which is the greatest danger that has ever hovered above our German Volk and against which we have been in battle for a year now."\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 30/09/1942, Sportpalast, Berlin, Germany"
sp_ger_stalingrad_speech:0 "Stalingrad Speech |2:13"
sp_ger_stalingrad_speech_desc:0 ""I should say that for my enemies, not for our soldiers. For the speed with which our soldiers have now traversed territory is gigantic. Also what was traversed this year is vast and historically unique. Now I do not always do things just as the others want them done. I consider what the others probably believe, and then do the opposite on principle. So if Mr. Stalin expected that we would attack in the center, I did not want to attack in the center, not only because Mr. Stalin probably believed I would, but because I didn't care about it any more at all. But I wanted to come to the Volga, to a definite place, to a definite city. It accidentally bears the name of Stalin himself, but do not think that I went after it on that account. Indeed, it could have an altogether different name. But only because it is an important point, that is, there 30 million tons of traffic can be cut off, including about 9 million of oil shipments. There all the wheat pours in from those enormous territories of the Ukraine, of the Kuban territory, then to be transported to the North. There the manganese ore was forwarded. A gigantic terminal was there; I wanted to take it. And do you know, we're modest: that is, we have it; there are only a couple of very small places left there. Now the others say: Why aren't you fighting there? Because I don't want to make a second Verdun but would rather do it with very small shock units. Time plays no part here. No ships come up the Volga any more-that is the decisive thing."\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 08/11/1942, Löwenbräukeller, Munich, Germany"

sp_ger_the_last_speech_desc:0 ""I therefore appeal in this hour to the entire German Volk, but especially to my old comrades in arms and all soldiers who are at its head, to arm themselves with an even greater, hardened spirit of resistance, until, as once before, we can lay on the grave of the dead of this mighty struggle a wreath with a bow inscribed: But you have triumphed in the end! I expect every German therefore to fulfill his duty to the utmost, and to take on every sacrifice that will be and must be demanded of him. I expect of every healthy man that he risk life and limb in this battle. I expect every ill, infirm, or otherwise indispensable man to work with the utmost effort. I expect the inhabitants of the cities to forge the weapons for this fight, and I expect every farmer to give bread to the soldiers and workers of this fight by limiting his own consumption as much as possible. I expect all women and girls to support this fight with the utmost zeal, as they have done up to now. I turn to the German youth with particular confidence. By forming such a committed community, we have the right to step before the Almighty and ask Him for His mercy and blessings. After all, a nation cannot do more than this: those who can fight, fight; those who can work, work; and all come together to sacrifice with only one thought in mind: to secure freedom, national honor, and a future for life. No matter how grave the crisis may be at this moment, we will overcome it in the end, in spite of everything, thanks to our unchangeable will, our readiness to sacrifice, and our abilities. We will survive this misery. In this fight, too, it is not Central Asia that will win but Europe! And at its head will be the one nation which, for one-and-a-half millennia, has represented Europe as its hegemonic power against the east and will represent it in the future: our Greater German Reich, the German nation!"\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 30/01/1945, Reich Chancellery, Berlin"

sp_ger_hitler_the_increase_of_german_production_ma_desc:0 ""If I increase production I increase the real income of my fellow-citizens. And if I reduce production I reduce that income, no matter what wages are paid out. Members of the Reichstag: Within the past four years we have increased German production to an extraordinary degree in all branches. And the whole German nation benefits by this increase. For it there is a demand today for very many million tons of coal more than formerly, this is not for the purpose of superheating the houses of a few millionaires to a couple of thousand degrees, but rather because millions of our German countrymen are thus enabled to purchase more coal for themselves with their increased income. By giving employment to millions of German workers who had hitherto been idle, the National Socialist Revolution has brought about such a gigantic increase in German production. That rise in our total national income guarantees the market value of the goods produced. And only in such cases where we could not increase this production, owing to certain conditions that were beyond our control, there have been shortages from time to time; but these bear no proportion whatsoever to the general success of the National Socialist struggle. The four-year plan is the most striking manifestation of the systematic way in which our economic life is being conducted. In particular this plan will provide permanent employment in the internal circulation of our economic life for those masses of German labour that are now being released from the armament industry. One sign of the gigantic economic development which has taken place is that in many industries today it is quite difficult to find sufficient skilled workmen. I am thankful that this is so; because it will help to place the importance of the worker as a man and as a working force in its proper light; and also because in doing so--though there are other motives also--we have a chance of making the activities of the party and its unions better understood and thus securing stronger and more willing support."\nAdolf Hitler, Führer, 30/01/1937, Reichstag, Berlin, Germany"

sp_ger_hitler_the_misery_of_the_sudeten_germans_ma_desc:0 ""Amongst the suppressed minorities in this state, there are also three and a half million Germans, roughly as many people of our race as Denmark has in inhabitants. These Germans are God’s creatures as well. The Almighty has not created them so that the construction arrived at in Versailles might place them at the mercy of an alien power they hate. And He has not created seven million Czechs either so that they may reign over these three and a half million, keep them in tutelage, and even far less did He create them to ravage and torture. The situation in this state has become unbearable, as is well known. In a political context, three and a half million people there are robbed of their right to self-determination in the name of the right to self-determination as construed by a certain Mister Wilson. In an economic context, these people are being ruined methodically and hence are subject to a slow but steady extermination. The misery of the Sudeten Germans defies description. One desires to destroy them. In a humanitarian context, they are being oppressed and humiliated in an unprecedented fashion. |...| All I can say to these representatives of democracy is that this does not leave us cold, no, if these tortured creatures can find neither justice nor help by themselves, then they will receive both from us. |...| It was a short-sighted enterprise which the architects of Versailles conceived when they gave birth to the abnormal structure of the Czechoslovakian state.

We have ordered our Government to communicate to the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that our empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration. To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations as well as the security and well-being of our subjects is the solemn obligation which has been handed down by our imperial ancestors and which we lay close to the heart. Indeed, we declared war on America and Britain out of our sincere desire to insure Japan's self-preservation and the stabilization of East Asia, it being far from our thought either to infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark upon territorial aggrandizement. But now the war has lasted for nearly four years. Despite the best that has been done by everyone--the gallant fighting of our military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of out servants of the State and the devoted service of our 100,000,000 people--the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest. Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.

sp_nzl_new_zealand_is_ready_desc:0 ""From the north across these peaceful waters comes a shadow: Japan. At last war really comes to New Zealand. Japan strikes without warning: west, east and south. Parliament assembles to discuss new grave dangers to our security. The war has been something very far away, intimate for us only because of the young men we have sent to it across the world's oceans. Now our own soil is threatened: we see for the first time the prospect of unfriendly feet attempting to despoil our land. What can we do? We have heavy batteries at our coastal defense positions. Over the outer waters we maintain a constant aerial patrol. Behind the patrolling squadrons are the lines of our bombers. Yes, those are our bombers. In our own waters watching our shipping lanes are the continuous patrolls of our men [sweeping fleet?]. Some have been built in our building by our own industry, some of the fleet have been converted from commercial vessels. Already one has been lost at the hazards of her task. Those round shapes in the water of our ports have already make this war seem more close to us. We think that Japan may have assisted the raiders that [layed?] the mines. Against air attacks, our cities are not so heavily guarded as the beleaguered towers of Britain. But neither are they so seriously menaced. We have anti-aircraft batteries and they are good. We have had great difficulties to overcome when organizing our defense, not the least of these the spaces of oceans separating us from our sources of supply. But this disadvantage is also our advantage. At the end of his journey to New Zealand, what would an enemy find? What if he survived the sea, the storms of our weather, and the fierce spirit of defense in our citizens? We would find that our military forces have been armed and trained so that adequate strength can be rushed at short notice to any point of danger. We have been making our own munitions as well as [lengthening?] our defense by importations. We have tanks, and heavy tanks they are too. Heavier by far than anything any enemy could land against the strength we should throw to meet him, and against our rage at his temerity in disturbing our New Zealand way of living. We have artillery for all purposes. Let it be admitted that New Zealand follows the ways of peace, while the Axis powers plan their [thrusts] and felonies. Let us admit that we are not as strong as nations which have planned for years how best to wage their war against the world, but we are no longer unwary or helpless against them. We have our resolution and our arms. We have fast and exceptionally mobile gun tractors and gun carriers: many of them made in our own factories by our own workmen. They are being used to [tour] these modern guns, the 25 pounders so successful in Libya and ready here for any aggressor too hasty in his greed. Our military forces are organized into lines of defense capable of cushioning and finally shaking off any blow that might be aimed against us. Everywhere in New Zealand battalions of the Home Guard, ordinary men in [rough and ready] cloths [arming] now with modern tools of war are making [the need] to help to take the first shock of attack in any district from sea to sea across the narrow islands in towns and villages overall our farm and mountain country. If he does come then we shall set the cost of disturbing into anger a people who fight for peace and not for [aggrandizement] of power. We have no cause to be too assured, but we are not without [weapons] of war. We have assembled much of the most modern equipment. We may not be Goliath but we have David's sling. Ready now at posts all through New Zealand, our men of the national military reserve since war began they have trained assiduously to fight from the sands by the sea to the hills behind us. Most of them are already [tried] in battle. All of them are waiting behind barbed wire sandbags, armed to shoot and to kill. Where armoured vehicles cannot easily travel to our countryside, so often rough and mountainous, we have horsemen, wild in their riding, reckless in their skill and tempestuous in their charge. Where troops can be deployed in numbers and with the mobility of modern warfare, we have our territorial army. No single man need march to meet an enemy. The people have given up their trucks, cars, motorcycles and petrol, so that our army can move far and fast and hit hard. We can quickly throw into battle anywhere at any time a substantial force of troops. They far exceed in number the total of any force any enemy could hope to bring across the sea unless all the rest of the decent world and our all ships from Britain and America were suddenly and impossibly gone from our support. And with our soldiers ready for that enemy are all our people, watching the sea and sky as sentries watch for danger from all quarters. We are standing behind the remparts of the seas around us and we are standing firm. If he comes across the sea, our enemy will find other barriers and if barbed wire and bullets failed to stop him and guns in all our many arms, then he will find us still determined. It is not for us to be ashamed of our efforts, nor overconfident. We need not be doubtful of our capacity or cocksure about our strength. We do our part when we know what we possess and when we understand how it must be improved. We do not shout our own praise, we do not [?] past failures. We are not too calm. We are confident, we have our hope for the future as a free nation of free people and we are dangerously angered that our earth and home should thus be menaced by an aggressor so advanced in the art of destruction and so reduced in the ideals of human progress. New Zealand is ready!"\nNational Film Unit, 21/12/1941"

Members of the Senate, and members of the House of Representatives, I will turn for one moment more from the turmoil and convulsions of the present to the broader spaces of the future. Here we are together, facing a group of mighty foes who seek our ruin. Here we are together, defending all that to free men is dear. Twice in a single generation the catastrophe of world war has fallen upon us. Twice in our lifetime has the long arm of fate reached out across the oceans to bring the United States into the forefront of the battle. If we had kept together after the last war, if we had taken common measures for our safety, this renewal of the curse need never have fallen upon us. Do we not owe it to ourselves, to our children, to tormented mankind, to make sure that these catastrophes do not engulf us for the third time? It has been proved that pestilences may break out in the Old World which carry their destructive ravages into the New World, from which, once they are afoot, the New World can not escape. Duty and prudence alike command first that the germ-centers of hatred and revenge should be constantly and vigilantly served and treated in good time, and that an adequate organization should be set up to make sure that the pestilence can be controlled at its earliest beginnings, before it spreads and rages throughout the entire earth."\nSir Winston Churchill, Prime minister of the United Kingdom, 26/12/1941, US Congress, Washington, D.C., United States of America"

Japan strikes without warning: west, east and south. Parliament assembles to discuss new grave dangers to our security. The war has been something very far away, intimate for us only because of the young men we have sent to it across the world's oceans. Now our own soil is threatened: we see for the first time the prospect of unfriendly feet attempting to despoil our land. What can we do? We have heavy batteries at our coastal defense positions. Over the outer waters we maintain a constant aerial patrol. Behind the patrolling squadrons are the lines of our bombers. Yes, those are our bombers. In our own waters watching our shipping lanes are the continuous patrolls of our men [sweeping fleet?]. Some have been built in our building by our own industry, some of the fleet have been converted from commercial vessels. Already one has been lost at the hazards of her task. Those round shapes in the water of our ports have already make this war seem more close to us. We think that Japan may have assisted the raiders that [layed?] the mines. Against air attacks, our cities are not so heavily guarded as the beleaguered towers of Britain. But neither are they so seriously menaced. We have anti-aircraft batteries and they are good. We have had great difficulties to overcome when organizing our defense, not the least of these the spaces of oceans separating us from our sources of supply. But this disadvantage is also our advantage. At the end of his journey to New Zealand, what would an enemy find? What if he survived the sea, the storms of our weather, and the fierce spirit of defense in our citizens? We would find that our military forces have been armed and trained so that adequate strength can be rushed at short notice to any point of danger. We have been making our own munitions as well as [lengthening?] our defense by importations. We have tanks, and heavy tanks they are too. Heavier by far than anything any enemy could land against the strength we should throw to meet him, and against our rage at his temerity in disturbing our New Zealand way of living. We have artillery for all purposes. Let it be admitted that New Zealand follows the ways of peace, while the Axis powers plan their [thrusts] and felonies. Let us admit that we are not as strong as nations which have planned for years how best to wage their war against the world, but we are no longer unwary or helpless against them. We have our resolution and our arms. We have fast and exceptionally mobile gun tractors and gun carriers: many of them made in our own factories by our own workmen. They are being used to [tour] these modern guns, the 25 pounders so successful in Libya and ready here for any aggressor too hasty in his greed. Our military forces are organized into lines of defense capable of cushioning and finally shaking off any blow that might be aimed against us. Everywhere in New Zealand battalions of the Home Guard, ordinary men in [rough and ready] cloths [arming] now with modern tools of war are making [the need] to help to take the first shock of attack in any district from sea to sea across the narrow islands in towns and villages overall our farm and mountain country. If he does come then we shall set the cost of disturbing into anger a people who fight for peace and not for [aggrandizement] of power. We have no cause to be too assured, but we are not without [weapons] of war. We have assembled much of the most modern equipment. We may not be Goliath but we have David's sling. Ready now at posts all through New Zealand, our men of the national military reserve since war began they have trained assiduously to fight from the sands by the sea to the hills behind us. Most of them are already [tried] in battle. All of them are waiting behind barbed wire sandbags, armed to shoot and to kill. Where armoured vehicles cannot easily travel to our countryside, so often rough and mountainous, we have horsemen, wild in their riding, reckless in their skill and tempestuous in their charge. Where troops can be deployed in numbers and with the mobility of modern warfare, we have our territorial army. No single man need march to meet an enemy. The people have given up their trucks, cars, motorcycles and petrol, so that our army can move far and fast and hit hard. We can quickly throw into battle anywhere at any time a substantial force of troops. They far exceed in number the total of any force any enemy could hope to bring across the sea unless all the rest of the decent world and our all ships from Britain and America were suddenly and impossibly gone from our support. And with our soldiers ready for that enemy are all our people, watching the sea and sky as sentries watch for danger from all quarters. We are standing behind the remparts of the seas around us and we are standing firm. If he comes across the sea, our enemy will find other barriers and if barbed wire and bullets failed to stop him and guns in all our many arms, then he will find us still determined. It is not for us to be ashamed of our efforts, nor overconfident. We need not be doubtful of our capacity or cocksure about our strength. We do our part when we know what we possess and when we understand how it must be improved. We do not shout our own praise, we do not [?] past failures. We are not too calm. We are confident, we have our hope for the future as a free nation of free people and we are dangerously angered that our earth and home should thus be menaced by an aggressor so advanced in the art of destruction and so reduced in the ideals of human progress.

These Germans are God’s creatures as well. The Almighty has not created them so that the construction arrived at in Versailles might place them at the mercy of an alien power they hate. And He has not created seven million Czechs either so that they may reign over these three and a half million, keep them in tutelage, and even far less did He create them to ravage and torture. The situation in this state has become unbearable, as is well known. In a political context, three and a half million people there are robbed of their right to self-determination in the name of the right to self-determination as construed by a certain Mister Wilson. In an economic context, these people are being ruined methodically and hence are subject to a slow but steady extermination. The misery of the Sudeten Germans defies description. One desires to destroy them. In a humanitarian context, they are being oppressed and humiliated in an unprecedented fashion. |...| All I can say to these representatives of democracy is that this does not leave us cold, no, if these tortured creatures can find neither justice nor help by themselves, then they will receive both from us. |...| It was a short-sighted enterprise which the architects of Versailles conceived when they gave birth to the abnormal structure of the Czechoslovakian state.

Most often built on a commercial ship hull - Casablanca-class escort carriers were built around the hulls of Liberty ships - they were too slow to keep up with the main fleet. However, they were adequate to escort convoys and provide air support to ground forces during amphibious landings. Escort carriers were cheap and could be built quickly, serving as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were scarce. Of the 151 aircraft carriers built by the U.S. during World War II, 122 were escort carriers, including 50 Casablanca class carriers and 45 Bogue class carriers."

Mexico's women still remember the humiliation as Diaz's economy forced them into poverty and then prostition. Families were ripped apart as a result, and historians claim this was one of the main reasons women fought so hard in the revolution and in huge numbers, out of pure hatred for Diaz's role in shattering their lives. The laws were hotly debated among doctors, prostitutes, feminist groups, and religious groups. Outside of religious groups, there was intense division over which stance they should take on prostitution. Ultimately, it was repealed to dismantle Porfiro Diaz's legacy and preserve the Mexican Revolution."

Banned foreigners from acting in a religious capacity. \n 3. banned priests of any kind from teaching in primary school. \n 4. Banned religion from being taught in school. \n 5. Church property within the federal District was confiscated.\n This law created the Cristero War, as the number of priests were restricted to the point 17 had no priest at all. Others had only a single priest to service an entire state. This caused unrest and inefficiency in the religious rural sections of Mexico. This was a hot topic until its repeal in 1938."
